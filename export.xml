      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>There are a lot of new developments in Copenhagen these days. An entire new suburb is being built by the water near where I live. It’s going to have its own metro stop and a new postcode. <br></p><p>Tens of buildings are coming up at the same time, they all look different from one another. There are grey ones and red ones, modernist townhouses and tall blocks. A cylinder building has been wrapped around an old silo. In the middle of what looks like a square, a four storey parking stands proud like a church. It even has frescos. It is if each developer has been given some lego blocks, just different bags. Walking around feels like browsing through a science exhibition. <br></p><p>There is something unique about the early days in a new suburb. Offices are occupied by real estate agents. Shops are showrooms where new home owners eagerly browse through tiles, lamps and wooden floors. Can you make your place unique by arranging them in a different way? Finished building stand side by side with construction grounds. An old lady’s neighbour is a crane. A little girl’s bedroom looks into a row of of containers where workers change and drink coffee. Only in the new suburb you can chose between an indoor toilet and an out door one.<br></p><p>Sometimes I go walk around in the new suburb. I want to see how life is born. The first person I come across is a young father trying to put his baby to sleep. Maybe she is the first native of that reclaimed land. A runner comes by, a couple is looking around, how would it feel to live there?<br></p><p>The day is ending, construction workers pack their stuff and are ready to leave. For months they have owned the place, but their rough jokes don’t belong there, the new suburb is going to be a fancy one. The first settlers are back from work and are busy trying to put life in their brand new apartments. Spices and flowers ornate the balconies from where they enjoy the sea view through the unfinished building in front. Today the sea, tomorrow another family watching tv. <br></p><p>Time feels suspended in the new suburb. Will all building be finished in the future or were they finished in the past? Maybe it is not a new suburb. Maybe a hurricane took them away.  </p>        <div class="posthaven-gallery" id="posthaven_gallery[1074406]">

      <title>Beyond the pyramid principle</title>

      <category domain="post_tag" nicename="what i think">What I think</category>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>In my consulting days, Barbara Minto’s (in)famous Pyramid Principle had the status of a gospel. <br></p><p>Consulting boils down to two essential things: persuasion and data. And given that data often can tell multiple stories at once (or that you can simply pick the data you want), persuasion is possibly the most important skill of a consultant. <br></p><p>The Pyramid Principle is all about that. Clear, structured communication, with the only goal of delivering a recommendation, proving a thesis, obtaining a (favourable) decision. <br></p><p>One of the main points in the “principle” is clearly structuring your thoughts <i>before</i> starting to write. The reason: once you have written something you are inevitably committed to it. Improving it <i>after</i> the ink has hit the paper becomes almost impossible. Even if no ink, and no paper, are involved.<br></p><p>Compare this approach with the open ended, exploratory nature of the “essay”, a style started by Montaigne and popularised in the tech circles by Paul Graham[1]. In this type of writing, not knowing (precisely) what you are going to write about is a deliberate decision, more than a simple stylistic choice. Writing in this form “doesn’t just communicate ideas; it generates them”, or in other words “ [the] writer writes to see what happens”. <br></p><p>The comparison can be stretched beyond the realm of literary forms. In a way, the two styles reflect opposite views of society. The pyramid principle, like the profession it has helped creating, is an offspring of the industrial economy. Its fundaments are clear facts (content) and clear planning (structure). It is Taylorism applied to writing. The open essay, on the other hand, is attuned with the <a href="https://medium.com/@stefanozorzi/flux-companies-850d77fed6bc#.ff2tkog1rhttp://" target="_blank">fluid nature</a> of today’s organisations. With a creative process that values action just as much as speculation. A process rooted on the idea that creation itself generates your thoughts. That you cannot tell where you are going before you start walking. <br></p><p>Barbara Minto is right, however, when warning against the risks of getting stuck in that unplanned first version. This is even more important in the explorative writing form. Using action to generate ideas assumes the ability to throw away dead ends, to completely re-write entire sections, to let the flow dictate the topic. Explorative writing is a metaphor of our “trial and error” society, a society that forces us to embrace uncertainty and where failure is the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/magazine/welcome-to-the-failure-age.htmlhttp://" target="_blank">natural flip side of innovation</a>. Learning how to destroy our creations becomes therefore a necessary skill, a resistance to pain that we all need to cultivate [3].<br></p><p>And so we are back to this post. I had started off writing about small stores based on a thought I had during the weekend as I was going out to buy some shorts. As I started, the post took a completely different turn, forcing me to think again about my initial idea and broadening it up to investigate whether people would pay a premium to preserve human jobs (it not only generates ideas, but also research topics). The post is still there and will take longer to finish. But it made me think about the value of writing, and the fundamental difference between this approach and writing simply to prove a point. Without starting on the small stores I wouldn’t have thought about the Pyramid Principle and this post would not exist. <br></p><p>It is a beautiful metaphor of life in the age of uncertainty, a life we all need to learn how to embrace. So, write, even if you don’t know about what. <br></p><p>—</p><p>[1] Paul Graham: Writing, briefly http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html</p><p>[2] William A. Covino: The Art of Wondering</p><p>[3] A great example of this is Amazon, “The best place in the world to fail”, as stated recently by Jeff Bezos. Not surprisingly, Amazon is one of the most successful company of our times.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>I am annoyed by the constant references to “elites” in the Brexit debate. As if city-dwelling, bachelor-holding, remain-supporting people were all part of some privileged class watching with contempt everybody else [1]. <br></p><p>I see nothing “elite” about the millions Erasmus students living abroad, nothing elite about the waiters and chefs and startup employees populating London and Berlin and Barcelona and many other European cities. <br></p><p>The vast majority of these people (and I put myself in this group) come from the same provinces, small cities and rural areas that in England have voted massively for <b></b>Brexit and where anti-EU parties get most of their support in other countries. Their parents are factory workers, civil servants, shop owners, small entrepreneurs. They went to (free) public schools and travelled around thanks to EU supported programs like Erasmus, where they learned to speak a new language and maybe fell in love with a boy or girl from another country. <br></p><p>The promise of Europe has nothing to do with privilege. And the majority of its supporter are the product of the inclusiveness, equality of opportunity, social and economical mobility that are the very heart of the European post WW2 identity. This is the exact opposite of elite. <br></p><p>What is true, however, it that we are failing at this promise. Keeping it alive is the only way we can stop this reckless ride. The alternative is hard cold wall. <br></p><p>---</p><p>[1] Some stats are <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/06/brexit-vote-statistics-united-kingdom-european-union/488780/" target="_blank">here </a><br></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Techno-determinism is an attitude I see in many people within tech. It manifests itself as the total refusal to accept any criticism of technology and its effects. In particular, it objects to any attempt to offer a critical view of society as shaped by our current technology. <br></p><p>It’s a weird phenomenon, as it contradicts one of the most fundamental belief of its own practitioners: human agency. Somehow, the same people who believe so deeply in the power of individuals to shape technology have no belief in the power of the same individuals to stir how technology shapes us. <br></p><p>Its weapons are derision, mockery, and hand-picked anecdotes. If you say that we are glued to our screens, they will call you luddite and show an image of people reading the newspaper. If you think that automation could take away jobs, they will post a quote from similar (turned out to be unfunded) fears a century ago. If you believe that social media reinforce a culture of tribalism  and opposition they will claim people want to live in bubbles. <br></p><p>Techno determinists are just as bad as the nostalgics they mock. In their blindness to the side effects of the technology they fund and build, they provide an easy target to their attackers. That’s not what the world needs. <br></p><p>The technology sector has long ago graduated from its inferiority complex. It is now time to go beyond “revenge time” and assume instead the sense of responsibility that its power require. </p><p>I am sure there are plenty of examples of people that at least try to pose themselves the right questions. I would just like to name 3 who deserve special praise for their ability to reconcile critical sense (awareness) and optimism. </p><p>- Tim O’Reilly and his Next:Economy initiative</p><p>- Albert Wenger for his thoughtful analysis of post-capitalist world</p><p>- Tristan Harris and his “time well spent” movement </p><p>Even more than their opinions, I share their attitude. We need more of that.</p><div><br></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Breaking non writing</title>

      <category domain="post_tag" nicename="what i think">What I think</category>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>In the last two years I have written somehow regularly on this blog. Writing is a masochist act. I want to do it, I love having it done, I find doing it extremely painful. But the most surprising aspect of writing is how quickly it can dry up. Every once in a while there are days when I simply cannot do it. Days of non-writing. </p>

<p>Cat chasing its tail. I get caught up in many other, mostly practical, tasks, the flow of ideas and reflections slows down, the blinking cursor on the empty screen gets intimidating. Stop. </p>

<p>I know what a good friend would say. This is not about inspiration, just sit down and write about something. Well, isn’t it what I am doing now? </p>

<p>I woke up early with the best intentions. I have a list of topics I’d like to know what I think about. That’s why I write. They are all difficult. I have no answer ready made. I am not here to teach something, to share an experience. I am here to figure it out. </p>

<p>Long awaiting topics: </p>

<ul>
<li>Technology at the periphery</li>
<li>Experience, sentiment, explanation</li>
<li>Longing for adventures, and if adventures are commodities is no-adventure and adventure?</li>
<li>Tradition and modernity</li>
</ul><p>New idea: </p>

<ul>
<li>Doing tough stuff (see below)</li>
</ul><p>And then there is that project: the Italian constitution, the value of work. I will get to that too. One foot in front of the other. </p>

<p>How many words now? 238. No, 240. I could actually go on like this and reach 500. Isn’t it 500 the magic number? 257. 258. Progress, how wonderful. 261.</p>

<p>I cheated. Got a message, answered, moved to another site, found something interesting, bookmarked, got even an idea for a new post: “doing tough stuff”. No, it wasn’t this. It sounded better before. Anyway, I’ll get to that one as well. I can add it above, done. I invented a time machine, and a circular reference. Maybe. </p>

<p>7.54, time to go. Must accelerate. I have a doubt now: that “anyways” above, I am not sure it’s right. ’s’ or no ’s’? Probably not. But if I look it up I’ll lose another 5 minutes, guaranteed. I hate grammar, I mean I hate doing it wrong. That’s probably not even grammar, it’s spelling. No, both words exist so it’s not spelling, it must be syntax. That’s for sure wrong, syntax is: “the set of rules, principles, and processes that govern the structure of sentences”. Not that. Yes, I looked it up: no ’s’. Something about the correct way and the slang way. I don’t buy that, but I buy this: “Furthermore, since “anyway” is an adverb and it is impossible for adverbs to be plural”. That’s it, it’s IMPOSSIBLE. Point. I could change it now, then this paragraph would make no sense. Done. Now I am smiling, this was fun. I have to do it again. </p>

<p>New, to-write, post: </p>

<ul>
<li>stream of consciousness to break non writing</li>
</ul><p>Academic title, too academic maybe? Is there another way to say it? Also, that has been done before. If you do something that was done before but it is not done so much because it was done already before does it get new again? Like, doing something “the old way” when everybody is doing “the new way” is actually doing something even newer. Need to include this in “tradition and modernity”. When I get to it. <del>570</del> 571. Amazing, even strikethrough counts. </p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Last week, I participated in the Anthemis hacking finance retreat. It was my third time and I was happy to see a lot of old friends and get to know a lot of new people.<br></p><p>As usual, there were a lot of great discussions during the three days. One thing was clear though: Politics has made a clear come back. In the past we have discussed politics more as “regulation” or, at most, as a laggard in a fast-changing society. But this time the mood was clearly different.</p><p>It “helped” that in the few days we were there the attacks of Nice and the (still very unclear) attempted coup in Turkey happened. It also “helped” that we were right after the Brexit vote and before the republic convention will make the Trump joke into a not so funny one. The mood was generally pessimistic, trending towards dystopian. Somebody made the appropriate comment that we reminded the French second estate summoned at Versailles: politely discussing about the events unfolding outside the doors of our palace, while (possibly) misunderstanding them. The lack of one single Brexit or Trump supporter did smell of croissant.</p><p>Politics then. Because we are getting out of a period where economic and technologic developments have been assumed to be sufficient to bring the world forward and heal all problems. A cold sweat awakening for people in this group: of the possible dystopian scenarios, a politically led one (democratically, no doubt) is still the most plausible one.</p><p>But for another reason as well. Because it is clear to the most now that solving these same challenges will require more than return-seeking free enterprise. Because there are challenges where the numbers simply don’t add up and where the bottomline can turn black only after accounting for positive externalities.</p><p>In this spirit, I was happy to come across a couple of promising initiatives. The first is <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.codeforamerica.org%2F&amp;t=MDhhZGM5YWI0YWNhZDZmNmYwMjA5ODdiNzAzZjc1ZjIzMzRlZGM0MixLT3o0bWZYUw%3D%3D">Code for America</a>, an initiative to bring tech talent to tackle hard (and not investment worthy) public challenges. The second is <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fa16z%2Fusds&amp;t=MmFmYTdmMGIzYjg2MjU3ZDM2OTRlODJmZGM4Y2IyM2IxN2FlYmI5NSxLT3o0bWZYUw%3D%3D">this profile</a> of the United States Digital Services. Again, these are only american examples (filter bubble anyone) but I am sure there is plenty of similar initiatives and thoughts in other countries.</p><p>This is the positive side we need to cling on, and push more. That more talented people will join the ranks of these initiatives and put their brains and hands to work for goals that can only be political in nature.</p><p>We might have been awaken to politics by the wrong reason. Let’s turn this into an opportunity to fix things.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>In "<a href="http://stefano.posthaven.com/politics-strikes-back" target="_blank">Politics strikes back</a>" I reported the feeling of a political renaissance among entrepreneurs. Two weeks later, I stumbled on this passage from an old essay by Albert Hirschman</p><p>        <div class="posthaven-gallery" id="posthaven_gallery[1086683]">
                  <p class="posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed">
          <img class="posthaven-gallery-image" src="https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1752529/AROMf6BuN4BeTa1Y1vv96fy0g24/Screen_Shot_2016-08-13_at_11.25.29.png" />
        </p>

        </div>
</p><p>Hirschman's words put my feelings into a framework. Consciously or not, there is today a broader understanding of the limits of economic and entrepreneurial activity as an agent of change. Their "marginal productivity" has reached a peak and further, meaningful, change will require getting our hands dirty with politics.<br><br>Now, what "politics" actually means remains an open question. <a href="http://twitter.com/tobdea" title="Link: http://twitter.com/tobdea">Tobia De Angelis</a> challenged me recently to broaden my own definition of politics. People <u>are</u> indeed doing politics to a much larger degree that we are normally ready to recognise. It just doesn't show itself in a traditional, party-led, way. </p><p>I see that, and I have promised myself to pay more attention to politics by other means. I remain afraid that this might not be sufficient until the grip of conventional politics is totally severed (will it ever be?). In the meantime, I am happy my sentiment has found its explanation (more on that soon). </p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The VR/AR escalator</title>

      <category domain="post_tag" nicename="what i think">What I think</category>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Two weeks ago I finally tried VR for the first time. I have been hooked since then. While I can feel the incredible potential of the tool, it is however too early, for me, to truly understand its implications. </p>

<p>Imagination of re-imagination is always limited at the beginning. The first ideas one gets are usually the obvious ones. In VR this means: better, more immersive, games, real-presence movies and documentaries, “live” apartment viewing. The difficult part is getting to the point where truly native experiences can be thought and developed. </p>

<p>Simon Lajboschitz, who runs Khora VR here in Copenhagen, helped me with two useful keys to frame expectations: </p>

<ol>
<li>Internet:Information = VR/AR:experience</li>
</ol><p>If the internet, especially in its first phase, is the democracy of information (wikipedia being its poster child), VR and AR will be the democracy of experiences. As an extension, we can plot a likely path into the future of VR and AR by taking existing information and “translating” them into experiences. For example, if today the internet allows us to learn about something by reading about it, tomorrow VR will allow us to learn about the same topic by experiencing it. </p>

<ol>
<li>AR and VR as an escalator</li>
</ol><p>Rather than being two different experiences, AR and VR are two directions of the same “escalator”. With VR, it is us going into the internet. With AR, it is the internet coming to us. </p>

<p>Both points share a critical element: the blurring of a clear demarcation between the “real” world and the web. I look forward to this change. In the last twenty years the internet has increasingly taken over our life. Yet the tool we use to access it are limited by a two dimensional form factor that feels like a straightjacket. </p>

<p>Our office environments are a clear example of this. Everyday we walk to a physical space and spend a large share (for most the majority) of our time facing a screen. With the exception of a few specific functions (coding, maybe, and design, at times) all other tasks don’t have an intrinsic need to be performed sitting at a desk, staring at a flat surface. Our working days have become way more stationary than they need to be, mostly due to the stationary nature of the web, trapped into our desktop computers and phones. </p>

<p>While for some VR can seem a further step in that direction, I expect it to be the opposite. Initially, wearing a mask (or a helmet) might feel like an additional step away from the “real” (debatable, naturally). Over time, it will liberate us from the constrains of the flat screen and bring back true freedom of movement (and interaction) to the workplace. </p>

<p>The age of VR and AR is starting. I feel excited. </p></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><i>Consider the following: In the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis in 2008, economists devoted a great deal of attention to the shortcomings of macroeconomic and financial models that, at best, failed to predict the breakdown, and, at worst, may have helped to bring it about. Hyman Minsky’s “financial instability hypothesis,” to which few previously had paid much attention, was newly celebrated; Eugene Fama’s “efficient-market hypothesis” was newly questioned. Yet, as events have unfolded, the profession has begun to take more seriously the structural factors that are shaping the twenty-first-century economy and driving economic outcomes that go beyond the business cycle. From the standpoint of the reconsideration of theory, this means shifting attention from macroeconomics to microeconomics and rethinking fundamental models of both consumption and production.</i></p>
<p><i>High on the list of models ripe for reconsideration is the “permanent income hypothesis,” introduced into the field of economics by Milton Friedman in 1957 in a book titled, A Theory of the Consumption Function. The idea, as we all know, is simple: Early in life, we as consumers optimize our lifetime earnings by going into debt to invest in education; education delivers the skills that form the foundation for a career. Early in our working lives, consumers stop investing in education and start to save. We keep saving increasing fractions of our income until, all at once, we retire. At that point, we spend down our savings, timing the depletion of savings to coincide perfectly with the depletion of … well, our lives.</i></p>
<p><i>The model Friedman developed of the arc of a human life is as technically sound today as it was in 1957. Furthermore—somewhat like the efficient markets hypothesis, which was also developed at the University of Chicago at about the same time—the permanent income hypothesis has become encoded in the operating system of the economy in such fundamental ways that we barely notice its influence. From the Pell Grants to the 401(k), the experience of consumers from youth to death remains framed by the notion that institutions are sufficiently slowly changing and we are sufficiently short-lived that we can invest (one time only) in education at the front of our lives to reap a reward that we ultimately enjoy at the end of life. Predictable and familiar policy prescriptions follow:</i></p>
</blockquote><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><ul><ul>
<li><i>Too much student debt and too few quality jobs for recent graduates? . . . Need more and better education.</i></li>
<li><i>Too much unemployment and too little stability in the labor market? . . . Need to spend more on worker protections.</i></li>
<li><i>Too many retired people and too little saving? . . . Need more and better health insurance.</i></li>
</ul></ul><blockquote>
<p><i>In a recent column for The New York Times, Robert Shiller wrote: “Most people complete the majority of their formal education by their early 20s and expect to draw on it for the better part of a century. But a computer can learn in seconds most of the factual information that people will get in high school and college, and there will be a great many generations of new computers and robots, improving at an exponential rate, before one long human lifetime has passed.” Colleges and universities have yet to respond adequately to these changes, Shiller concluded. “We will have to adapt as information technology advances . . . . We must continually re-evaluate what is inherently different between human and computer learning.”</i></p>
<p><i>Shiller is right: We need to update our thinking about the function of higher education. We also need to update our thinking about workforce training, retirement, and aging to fit the realities of the twenty-first century</i>.</p>

</div>Photo by Russell Davies on Flickr<p><em>In this post, I start from the recent strike performed by riders of the UK delivery startup Deliveroo to look at alternative scenarios concerning the creation of “good jobs”. I claim that “good jobs” are not about the relationship between jobs and technology but rather a product of the total value created by it. Attempts to enforce the creation of good jobs through redistribution are bound to fail in the absence of sufficient value to be shared. On the other hand, protecting “poor jobs” by out-of-market subsidies like tax credits and basic income will result in a lose-lose situation where neither innovation nor fairness are achieved. Understanding the unintended consequences of alternative actions should lead us to a different approach: less interventionist and more evolutionary.</em></p>
<p>What is a good job? And, how can we protect the one we have while creating more of them?</p>
<p>The recent successful strike conducted by riders of the UK delivery startup Deliveroo offers a good chance to look at these questions in a practical case, outside generic and buzzword-laden discussions about the future of work.</p>
<h3>Machine jobs, human jobs and “good” jobs</h3>
<div>
<div></div>
<div><img src="https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1600/1*LfFcGHrw9u-JEjMeTikG1A.jpeg" title="Image: https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1600/1*LfFcGHrw9u-JEjMeTikG1A.jpeg"></div>
</div>
<p>A typical mistake we make when talking about the future of work is to think of jobs created by new technology as involving, by default, sophisticated skills, new knowledge, or both. In short, an advancement on what we used to do before. While this is true for some people, it is not a general rule.</p>
<p>A more realistic approach is to look at jobs that humans can do because we are better at them than machines, where better doesn’t stand for “more intelligent”, but rather “diversely intelligent”. Historically, technology has relentlessly taken over tasks that were a good fit for it, humans have kept everything else (which, to be fair, includes a whole amount of new jobs being created). A cynical way of putting it would be to say that humans occupy the space left over by the machines [1].</p>
<p>The gig economy, and in particular food delivery, is no different in this sense. It is a product of information technology. On the buyer side, twenty years of e-commerce and now almost ten of smartphones have created the very basis for the on-demand movement, liberating latent desires to get everything we want, when we want it. On the the supply side, the same tech allows people to find work (and to be found by it) anywhere, anytime. All glued together by beautifully designed digital platforms. Discovery, recommending, searching, matching: all machine tasks. Delivering, especially if done by bike in a busy city: human task [2].</p>
<p>Seen in this light, there is nothing intrinsically bad about gig economy jobs. They are an updated manifestation of a machine-enabled division of labour started in the industrial age [3]. Pushing the argument a bit further, the emergence of the gig economy demonstrates what technology optimists keep saying: new tech creates new jobs, possibly more than those it deletes.</p>
<p>What makes then people so worried, and workers so upset? What makes these jobs worse, in the public eye, than “good old” industrial economy manufacturing (or clerical) jobs? Or, looking from the other side, what made these better? They didn’t need special skills, they didn’t need high education, and they could count on plenty of supply. The answer, as <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-dont-miss-manufacturing-they-miss-unions/?ex_cid=story-twitter&amp;imm_mid=0e3eb5&amp;cmp=em-na-na-na-newsltr_econ_20160520" target="_blank">a survey of recent researches</a> performed by the magazine fivethirtyeight shows, might come as a surprise:</p>
<p><em>“…this much is clear: For all of the glow that surrounds manufacturing jobs in political rhetoric, there is nothing inherently special about them. Some pay well; others don’t. They are not immune from the forces that have led to slow wage growth in other sectors of the economy. When politicians pledge to protect manufacturing jobs, they really mean a certain kind of job: well-paid, long-lasting, with opportunities for advancement. Those aren’t qualities associated with working on a factory floor; they’re qualities associated with being a member of a union</em>.”</p>
<p>Which takes us back from where we started: the Deliveroo strike.</p>
<h3>Bringing unions back to the gig economy</h3>

</div>DonkeyHotey on Flickr<p>It would seem, therefore, that what gig economy jobs have lacked so far in order to improve their status is collective bargaining power. The same that led to the painfully achieved social contract of the post war years and turned industrial jobs into “good jobs” even when, as it proved later, this was a distortion of free market dynamics. I will get back to this point shortly.</p>
<p>To confirm this impression, it is sufficient to look at the reactions the Deliveroo strike generated among sympathetic observers. Like the New Economic Foundation (NEF), a “think tank promoting social, economic and environmental justice”, which in a <a href="http://www.neweconomics.org/blog/entry/deliveroo-strikes-collective-bargaining-in-the-tech-age" target="_blank">recent comment to the events</a> wrote:</p>
<p><em>“Insecure, badly paid work is bad news for the economy overall. A weak voice for employees’ rights leads to a lopsided share of national income going to company profits and sitting in banks, rather than into wages and spending in the real economy</em>.”</p>
<p><em>“The divide and conquer approach of splitting up this workforce into thousands of ‘self-employed’ contractors, managed via an app, may seem appealingly efficient to an employer. But the power imbalance created is counterproductive if we look at the bigger economic picture</em>.”</p>
<p><em>“This victory, however small, is symbolically very significant. The strike is an example of collective bargaining navigating a new frontier of app-enabled work — and the new power imbalances that come with it</em>.”</p>
<p>According to the people at NEF, we are facing essentially a question of redistribution, where “collective bargaining” will prove key to navigate the “power imbalances” that come with “app-enabled work”.</p>
<p>What these commentaries miss is the reason, along with the possibilities created by technology, why gig economy jobs exist in the first place. They have not only suffered from power imbalances, they own their very existence to these imbalances. To put it more clearly: these jobs have emerged in the last years thanks to a regulatory loophole (the independent worker vs employee status) which has allowed the achievement of a lower-than-normally-permitted equilibrium between demand and supply (a “clearing price” if we want). But while this low clearing price has provided the fuel to kick start innovation in the on-demand segment, its days may be numbered. At least in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/19/collective-action-via-social-media-brings-hope-to-gig-economy-workers" target="_blank">view of union leader Mags Dewhurst</a>:</p>
<p><em>“..this kind of tech has been designed to isolate individuals and atomise work, deskilling the industry and driving down wages…”</em></p>
<p><em>“…the difficulty we faced had been accessing them. How do you reach thousands of people when they are spread around London? I was literally chasing them down the street if I saw a blue jacket.”</em></p>
<p>but…</p>
<p><em>“The biggest problem people face is getting in contact with each other. Once they are in contact and they have decided to work with one voice, they have effectively unionised and the company is screwed.”</em></p>
<p><em>“This [the Deliveroo strike] is just a taste of what could happen when low-paid workers campaign together”</em></p>
<p>The recent strike may well put an end to the low clearing price of the gig economy (at least part of it). But is the overall economics of the model sufficient now to redistribute the pie? Or..</p>
<h3>Can gig economy jobs be “good jobs”?</h3>
<p>The answer to this question is likely to be negative. Looking at why this is the case can help us understand some of the characteristics that make a good job sustainable.</p>
<p>Let’s start by looking at the redistribution-through-unionisation option.</p>
<p>Gig economy jobs (delivery in particular) carrie an intrinsic weakness that practically makes it impossible for them to become good jobs just based on a redistribution of power between the parties. The short version is that they create too little additional value between the restaurant and the customer for both the platform and the worker to benefit from it [4]. Ultimately, delivery companies simply cannot afford to offer better conditions to their riders.</p>
<p>Workers are faced therefore by a real “squeeze”. In the short term, the acceptance of their requests (and thereby the removal of the low clearing price) has good chances to put their employers out of business. In the long term, increasing the cost of delivery might create a sufficient incentive to push for automation [5]. No matter how we see it, a better bargaining power from the workers side will likely destroy the long term prospect of delivery jobs to become sustainable [6].</p>
<p>An alternative option is what liberal thinkers in my twitter feed have been advocating: redistribution after market equilibrium.</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Minimum wages kill employment and innovation. Redistribution must happen after labor market equilibrium. <a href="https://t.co/ZkAGNN9BdV">https://t.co/ZkAGNN9BdV</a></p>— Max Niederhofer (@maxniederhofer) <a href="https://twitter.com/maxniederhofer/status/764204895318794241">August 12, 2016</a>
</blockquote></p>
<p>This position is clear. Improved bargaining power (which is what will achieve minimum wage for Deliveroo riders) might be good in the short term, but it has an overall negative effect for the economy as it stiffens innovation and limits employment opportunities [7]. This is basically an argument to maintain the low clearing price mentioned above, without putting the burden entirely on the workers’ shoulders. The alternative is for someone else to take fill the gap, and that someone is the “public”. An example of this redistribution outside of labor market equilibrium is tax credits, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/better-than-raising-the-minimum-wage-1432249927" target="_blank">advocated in the US by prominent business leaders like Warren Buffe</a>t as a measure to be preferred over the distorting effects of minimum wages.</p>
<p>But it is not so simple. On one hand, maintaining an artificially low cost of labour puts a (publicly subsidised) break on innovation, as the incentive for these companies to automate will be lower. On the other, it risks satisfying only partially the request of the riders, in particular their intangible, but equally important, sense of fairness. Their economic needs might be taken care of, but they will probably still feel “exploited” as competition for work coupled with a strong system of tax incentives pushes the salary per hour towards zero. Profit will be accumulated at the corporate level (in few hands) while society will foot the bill [8].</p>
<p>To recap:</p>
<p>Unionisation satisfies better our sense of fairness but ultimately has low chances of achieving the objective of turning bad jobs into sustainably good ones. Outside-of-market corrections seem to have a better chance of saving the jobs (assuming this is really what we want) but to do so require a privatisation of benefit and a socialisation of costs (both in terms of innovation and financially).</p>
<p>An interesting dilemma:</p>
<p>Fair but bad for jobs vs. Good for jobs but unfair</p>
<h3>Other possibilities</h3>
<p>Basic income:</p>
<p>A discussion about the future of work would not be complete these days without talking about basic income. Leaving for another time the different nuances of the concept, in this specific instance I see its effects in many ways similar to those of tax credits. The main difference between the two is that tax credits require the beneficiary to have a job, basic income doesn’t. This will likely generate less competition for delivery jobs and less downward pressure on wages, but I don’t expect basic come to simply make supply disappear (and therefore push for more automation). People on basic income will keep looking for jobs driven by the desire to increase their disposable income (even in the most ambitious proposals still quite low by general standards) while having less incentive to “fight” for a minimum wage compared to a situation without neither basic income nor a system of tax credits.</p>
<p>Modern cooperatives:</p>
<p>Another option is to maintain the low clearing price by eliminating platform profits. Riders owned cooperative could keep the price of delivery low enough to be acceptable for customers but high enough to be sustainable for riders. Automation would be the only real long term challenge, as companies that want to reintroduce profits into the picture would do it by substituting the cooperatives with robots as soon as that option becomes economically sustainable.</p>
<p>Voluntary pay:</p>
<p>A true market change would come if customers themselves shift their willingness to pay for human deliveries. This would immediately increase the size of the pie and, depending on how much more they would like to pay, make room for a redistributive scenario. The consumer dilemma between “cheaper” and “more sustainable” is well known (watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXmnBbUjsPs" target="_blank">“The High Cost on Low Price”</a>, documentary about Walmart) and a change of heart<a href="http://www.ivanmazour.com/deliveroos-vs-deliverees-revolution-coming/" target="_blank">doesn’t seem to be anywhere near</a>. On the other hand, the organic food movement proves that for some principles people are ready to pay more, but this requires an entire discussion on its own which I leave for another time.</p>
<h3>What have we learned?</h3>
<p>Time to draw some conclusions.</p>
<p>Good jobs require stronger fundamentals. This might be obvious but it is worth repeating.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wealth creation comes from true innovation (technological or in business models) where additional value is released in the economy. If innovation limits itself to the exploitation of a temporary arbitrage it wont survive the inevitable pressure for redistribution that is bound to emerge no matter what.</li>
<li>Focusing on the machine vs. human dichotomy is good for headlines but it distracts us from identifying tasks where humans have a sustainable role to play. This is more dependant on economic factors than pure technical feasibility of a given automation.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is really no easy way out. No amount of external intervention, being it pre- or post-market equilibrium can guarantee the creation, and maintenance, of good jobs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Going back to old protections have a normal element of fairness (and I am myself tempted to wish for it when i read the stories in the newspaper) but is no long term solution.</li>
<li>Deep market corrections (although more innovative and pro-market like tax credits and even basic income) have nonetheless a distorting effort. Paradoxically, they will postpone innovation and keep human in low skills job (for those that think this is a problem).</li>
</ul>
<h3>What do I think about all this?</h3>
<p>I started writing this post as a way to understand what was going on and to look tangibly at different scenarios and their implications. As it often happens, the more you try to genuinely understand a topic the more you realise that there is no simple answer. That would be too easy. But since it is wrong to just sit and comment without proposing something I’ll indicate my preferred choice.</p>
<p>Faced by competing choices with no apparent (at least not to me) solution that achieves both innovation, job stability and fairness, I consider non-intervention to be preferred. So, no intervention to settle the dispute by imposing a min wage, and no helping hand (at least not explicit) to the company by appeasing workers through other public transfers.</p>
<p>This position is not motivated by a blind acceptance of the “invisible-hand” but rather by the acknowledgment that each choice opens up for a range of “unintended consequences” that risk overshadowing even the best original intentions. In situation of high uncertainty, policymaking should refrain from the temptation to impose a specific solution and adopt instead a “stewardship” approach as advocated by <a href="http://evonomics.com/the-deep-and-profound-changes-in-economics-thinking/" target="_blank">Eric Beinhocker and the “complexity economics” school</a></p>
<p><em>“…rather than engineering specific outcomes, government’s role as system stewards is to create the conditions in which interacting agents in the system will adapt towards socially desirable outcomes”</em></p>
<p>In our case, this means levelling the playing field between riders and platforms, removing information advantages (for example with better access and export right for riders’ data) and allowing therefore a more natural rebalancing of power, also through collective action.</p>
<p>In a way, my suggestion is about embracing the historical process by which a job first starts outside of the controlled labour market, then gets rebalanced , and if it is not able to survive, disappears or gets automated. It is not the end of the world, it’s evolution.</p>
</div><div><hr></div><div><div>
<p>[1] I subscribe in full here to Venkatesh Rao’s definition of machine work as “algorithmically-scalable work” and human-work as “work that is not worth automating. This is a combination of work being hard to automate and low returns to the automation due to limited algorithmic scaling potential (a good example is tax software for parts of the tax code that change very frequently).” <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2013/07/10/you-are-not-an-artisan/" target="_blank">http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2013/07/10/you-are-not-an-artisan/</a></p>
<p>[2] Yes, I am perfectly aware that self-driving cars are coming and that people are working on projects like <a href="https://www.starship.xyz/" target="_blank">https://www.starship.xyz/</a> . Even so, delivering small parcels and food in highly dense urban areas (including walking up staircases at times) is a costly endeavour for machines and not a place to look for high “algorithmic scaling potential” (see above)</p>
<p>[3] Gig economy jobs receive a lot of criticisms for being “bad jobs”. For the purpose of this discussion I have decided to leave out the “servitude” argument, criticising these jobs for not exploiting the full “human” potential and for being the manifestation of a widespread inequality in society (rich of money poor of time on one side, rich of time poor of money on the other).</p>
<p><em>“The Servitude Bubble is condemning people who might be doing amazing, wondrous, and miraculous things to be butlers, maids, dog-walkers, net-servants — or, perhaps worse, code-monkey enforcers who, chasing their own little payday, make people into net-servants.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/bad-words/the-servitude-bubble-c9e998c437c6#.krbite12a" target="_blank">https://medium.com/bad-words/the-servitude-bubble-c9e998c437c6#.krbite12a</a></p>
<p>[4] Here, a distinction between Uber and the majority of other gig jobs needs to be made. Uber innovates more deeply into the structure of its industry. By streamlining operations (eliminating a large part of the overhead in traditional taxi dispatching business) and by liberating latent demand for a business with low variable costs, it allows, in principle, enough room for both platform and drivers to benefit. Food delivery, on the other hand, operates in a business where variable costs (food) are high and where it is much more difficult to find optimisation elsewhere. With little operational efficiencies to be achieved on the production side (the restaurant) and a ceiling on the price side imposed by the consumers’ willingness to pay and constant fear of new investor-subsidised entrants, there is simply not enough room for both. An extensive coverage of this point can be found <a href="http://qz.com/722230/postmates-has-failed-to-make-uber-for-anything-cheap/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>[5] Even where a certain job is not obviously a “machine job”, sufficient economic incentive might change the picture.</p>
<p>[6] This is also easily demonstrated by the fact that these jobs don’t exist in settings where the clearing price was simply not allowed to go lower enough .</p>
<p>[7] Low clearing price jobs (and people that take them) prove that there is latent demand for jobs even below what people normally think is fair.</p>
<p><em>“However, the fact that online platforms can attract workers in large numbers despite relatively unappealing conditions is an indictment of the labour market in many of the countries where they operate. In France, many Uber drivers come from the deprived banlieues and say that discrimination prevents them finding mainstream employment. In the US, a study by JPMorgan found that people used online platforms mainly to help them weather a dip in their regular earnings — as an alternative to cutting spending or running up debts.”</em></p>
<p>https://www.ft.com/content/30d06228–20da–11e6–9d4d-c11776a5124d</p>
<p>[8] Somebody still believes in “trickle down effects” and in the possibility to effectively tax corporate profits. I don’t.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>A known fact about startups is that most of the really successful ones looked like bad ideas at the beginning. This statement shouldn’t surprise and it is indeed a truism if we agree with another common knowledge in investing: to achieve superior returns you need to be right where everybody else thinks you are wrong. </p>

<p>The acceptance of this fact has generated a funny phenomenon, driven by an evident logical fallacy. If most great ideas looked like very bad ideas then every very bad idea could hide a great one. </p>

<p>It is obviously the investor’s job (and even before that, the founder’s) to distinguish “real” bad ideas from good ideas that just look like bad ideas. But it is not an easy feat. In doubt, most people tend to shy away from calling out a “real” bad idea when they see it. The internet has a long memory, and you don’t want to look like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAV2Gjkhztg">these guys </a>. </p>

<p>There is a sort of collective hallucination. Founders are pushed to come up with the craziest idea possible, anything short the Elon would make you “unambitious”, observers that in lack of courage calls them “bold”, lots of puzzled faces looking hesitantly at each others. A modern version of The Emperor’s New Clothes. </p>

<p>Who will play the child?</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Elites control money and mass media, but crowd funding and social media now dominant. Bernie and Trump are just first of many insurgents.</p>— Naval Ravikant (@naval) <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/779624513457840128">September 24, 2016</a>
</blockquote>
<p>2016 will go down as the year where everybody woke up to the power of internet crowds. The year where the anti-hierarchical nature of the web manifested all its influence on the political discourse. “Gradually, then suddenly”. </p>

<p>This story has been covered a lot and well. Another aspect has received less attention. Together with the rise of the crowds we witness the demise of the silent majority. </p>

<h1>Silent majority and the illusion of consensus</h1>

<p>Since Nixon made the expression popular in 1969, the idea of a silent majority has been often used in antithesis to nosier positions and groups. From pacifist movements to labour unrest to football hooligans. For every group resorting to noise to manifest its dissent, there is a moderate majority which needs to be protected. </p>

<p>But what does this majority stand for? Silence is not neutral as it might be assumed. Silence is communication just like “no ideology” is an ideology of its own. The concept of a silent majority presumes the existence of a tacit consensus, one that doesn’t require to be expressed noisily but somehow exists objectively. </p>

<p>Many in the past 20 years have promoted the existence of an objective consensus. The end of the cold war was meant to unleash a post-ideological (or post-political) era. An era of technocratic governments following fundamental laws and the rule of the obvious. Political debates moved from the material to the personal, economics (the most “scientific” of social sciences) took over the scene. </p>

<p>Yet this assumption of consensus, this illusion really, contains the seeds of its own destruction. Blinded by the pretence of objectivity, the bearer of consensus becomes subject to the worst form of ideology. Not only does he claim not to have one, he also scorns anyones who does. Over time, this superiority becomes laziness. The ranks of the “objective truth” start shrinking, those that still benefit from it turn into defence mode while the rest fall easily into the arms of the emerging crowds. It shouldn’t surprise that is it now Trump’s turn to waive the flag of the silent majority. </p>

<p>There is probably no better, and tragic, example of this trajectory than the EU. The European project started as an idealistic attempt, smart enough to understand the need for a pragmatic anchor. Just like a startup that requires both an ambitious vision and a tangible beachhead to achieve traction, the EU found its own in economic integration, initially within the coal and steal niche. Over time, the beachhead expanded. The economic rationale became the main motor of integration, “obvious” enough that it didn’t even need to be justified. The how and the what took over from the why. The consensus was clear, until it wasn’t anymore.</p>

<h1>Moderates and radicals</h1>

<p>The illusion of consensus goes hand in hand with the mirage of moderation. The belief that there is always a neutral space in between opposed factions. It’s a comforting feeling: “I want order but I am not a racist”, “I like equality but I am not a socialist”. It’s the temptation of simple solutions, defined negatively as a watered down version of extreme positions. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, moderation leads often to the same results as the illusion of consensus. Because moderates don’t really stand for anything they end up retrenching into an assumed sense of superiority, justified by some sort of objectivity in their position. It’s the <a href="https://medium.com/@nntaleb/the-intellectual-yet-idiot-13211e2d0577">“intellectual yet idiot”</a> targeted recently by Nassim Taleb.</p>

<p>A good example can be found in this discussion of <a href="http://www.macroresilience.com/2013/04/08/radical-centrism-uniting-the-radical-left-and-the-radical-right/">“pragmatic vs radical centrism”</a>. Pragmatic choices are directly linked to the crony capitalisms resulting from the lack of true disagreement between alternative visions of the common. When a pragmatic centre-right and a pragmatic centre-left join forces in a grand coalition, “the range of policy options is narrowed down to a pragmatic compromise that maximises the rent that can be extracted by special interests.“ </p>

<p>Radicalism is the opposite of moderation. It’s a positively defined position. Radicals stand <strong>for</strong> something. </p>

<p>Adopting a radical position doesn’t mean playing at the extremes (you can easily be, as seen above, a radical centrist), and it doesn’t mean accepting rules of engagement based on harassment and provocation. It means rejecting the illusion of consensus and the false comfort of moderation. It means taking up the challenge of active political participation, well aware that in 2016 it doesn’t require joining a political party or even voting for one. </p>

<h1>Compromises and coexistence</h1>

<p>Does this means giving up to tribalism? To a state of permanent conflict, a social media powered cacophony of noisy crowds? </p>

<p>That’s certainly not a desired state, but it is more a question of how we design the arena of our disagreements, rather than suppressing them. In the past, the parliament was the primary place of debate, negotiation, compromise and coexistence. That place is today both limited and outdated. Our new public spaces are larger and more inclusive. But they are also driven by dynamics that foster closure at the expense of openness (the filter bubbles), short outburst of anger over longer, more considerate, reflections. Beyond that, we need a culture of dialogue which simply acknowledges our disagreements while realising that coexistence is really our only option. </p>

<p>2016 has proven that there is really no escape from the bottom-up explosion of the crowds. The “insurgents”, as Naval calls them in the tweet above, cannot be stopped with money and media control. Those that disagree with them need to embrace the new reality. Forget silence, forget neutrality. Welcome to politics.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>If such a thing as “the perfect recipe to build a large successful company” existed, it would probably read like this:<br></p><div>
<ul>
<li>Start with great vision leading to large market</li>
<li>Identify opening or angle to attack it</li>
<li>Build initial version targeting your early adopters</li>
<li>Gain traction</li>

</div><div>(A man with a plan)<p>The truth is that very few cases like this actually exist (Elon’s <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me" target="_blank">secret master plan</a> being one of them). The majority of mortals find themselves often in two different, but equally challenging, situations. Similar to a form of light induced blindness.</p>
<h4>When vision blinds traction</h4>
<p>The first one is “the entry point” challenge. In some cases the vision is clear, the opportunity is there to grab (often to the point of being “obvious”) but you just cannot find the right way to start.</p>
<p>The importance of finding the right entry point can hardly be overstated. From Geoffrey Moore’s “Enthusiasts and Visionaries” to Steve Blank’s “Earlyvangelist” to Peter Thiel’s “small niche” (to be dominated), everybody out there knows how critical it is to start with the right users.</p>
<p>But looking at it only from the point of view of a segment misses the point. It is rather the combination of: addressing the right users, with the right value proposition, delivered through the right set (preferably as small as possible) of features and the right channel. It’s what David Galbraith calls “<a href="http://davidgalbraith.org/anthemis/venture-design-and-the-anthemis-fintech-foundry/3895/" target="_blank">ecosystem fit</a>: the starting point for the path to capture the opportunity”.</p>
<p>What it boils down to is the ability to gain traction, beyond any doubt. Lots of things can be fixed when there is traction (from hiring to fundraising to differences of opinions in the team), but when you are struggling to make things work even the best relationships will start showing cracks.</p>
<p>In these situations, the presence of a clear vision and a large opportunity can paradoxically make things worse. Rob Go explained this with extreme clarity in <a href="http://robgo.org/2016/09/07/the-shape-of-traction/" target="_blank" title="Link: http://robgo.org/2016/09/07/the-shape-of-traction/">one of the best post I have read on the topic</a> (and podcast):</p>
<blockquote>There is this risk that you feel (traction) is always around the corner, we just need to launch this product or this feature or get this level or critical mass.. and it’s always at the end of the horizon..</blockquote>
<p>The presence of a large market will make it so that you can get a few customers by working really hard. And the clarity of the opportunity will give you the energy to endure. But in the end, these signals will mislead you by not pushing you hard enough to change more drastically and find the “real” entry point.</p>
<h4>When traction blinds vision</h4>
<p>There is then a second challenge, at the opposite extreme. Startups, or rather products, that have found traction or are just close to it but where it is hard to imagine what the next step would be.</p>
<p>Let’s say you have created a nice to-do app, you could certainly turn a profit around that (<a href="http://t.co/Wjz7HZIAuk" target="_blank">and even a good exit</a>) but it takes serious strategy work to go from a product with traction to a business with huge revenue potential. Fred Wilson <a href="http://avc.com/2016/09/team-and-strategy/" target="_blank">talked about this recently</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Most of the companies I work with didn’t really start out with a strategy. They started out with an idea that turned into a great product that found a fit with a market. And they jumped on that and used it to build a company. Most of them wake up at some point and realize that a single product in a single market is not a strategy and they need to come up with a plan to get a lot bigger and build a sustainable and defensible business.</blockquote>
<p>When looking at these two challenges, many people would be inclined to pick the second one. It is definitely easier to figure out the next step when things are going well — the proverbial “luxury problem” — but there is also a counter argument. Having found your local maximum can turn into a trap, and lead the team into a blind alley with no clear path to the next stage. Lack of vision and clear strategy will result in endless discussions around what to do next, possible feature creep and ultimately throwing away the original traction.</p>
</div><div><hr></div><div><div><p>Following the perfect recipe sounds great, but it’s rarely how life looks like. If you are facing one of these two challenges the best you can do is to acknowledge them and avoid letting your vision, or your traction, blind you.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Notes from a wannabe tech ecosystem</title>
      <link>http://stefanozorzi.xyz/notes-from-a-wannabe-tech-ecosystem</link>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Founders is a startup studio based in Copenhagen. We are proud of our origins and we really hope to participate in building a strong tech ecosystem in this town.</p>

<p>Copenhagen has captured a lot of media attention recently. It’s labelled as a true “up and coming” tech hub. There are plenty of conferences, plenty of talks, plenty of good hopes. And some good realities.</p>

<p>All this can have a positive spin. It can help an entire community suspend disbelief and take the risks required to actually build something real. It’s “fake it until you make it” applied to a city.</p>

<p>But there are issues we have to discuss, and some bad signs that if not stopped in time can ruin even the little good we have. </p>

<p>Here is my list of challenges, bright spots and two suggestions.</p>

<h1>Challenges</h1>

<h2>Drought of tech talent</h2>

<p>Copenhagen has too little tech talent. Not enough people chose that type of education in the past and most of them got lured by attractiveness of “safe jobs” in large corporation or IT consulting firms. The rest are fragmented in a multitude of startups, either too small to matter or just not going anywhere. There is an obvious problem with abundance of grants and generosity of seed and angel investors which are keeping too many small teams alive. A sign of maturity would be to cut losses on many of these teams and let the best people join the best companies.</p>

<p>This is not something we are immune from at Founders and we are working on fixing it.</p>

<h2>Startup lifestyle vs. building large companies</h2>

<p>Working on a startup is still more of a lifestyle choice than the desire to build a long lasting company. Too many founders are motivated more by the goal of avoiding corporate life (or having a boss all together) than by true ambition.</p>

<p>I have nothing against bootstrapping and being solo-entrepreneurs (especially if you can turn 40k in MRR with a product in autopilot while learning new skills and travel the world). But an agglomerate of micro teams and lone wolves working from co-working spaces won’t turn Copenhagen into a tech ecosystem in the same way it is not turning Bali into one.</p>

<h2>Too much of the asshole gene pool is wasted in corporates</h2>

<p>Great companies are created by people with the right amount of “asshole” gene. Characteristic of these individuals is an insatiable drive for success and since success and money are too easily equated, big business and finance have been for a generation the natural destinations of the asshole gene pool. We might not like it, but the booming tech scene in the US owns a lot to the flow of assholes-in-the-making opting for Silicon Valley instead of Wall Street and for Computer Science instead of an MBA.</p>

<p>In Copenhagen today there is still enough fat in the corporate ladder to attract most of the assholes. Many will find enough purpose in a nice house in the suburbs and will satisfy their competing edge with their ironmans and triathlons. Others will realise, maybe too late, that they made the wrong bet. This is already happening and it’s only growing. Just check the amount of business school, consulting, banking profiles going around looking for a technical co-founder.</p>

<h2>No real tech industry</h2>

<p>Beside a few startups breaking out from the pack there are some large IT consulting companies (admittedly doing quite well) and some old school software companies, mostly spin-offs from government IT services. This is not a tech industry.</p>

<p>The issue goes beyond the lack of tech talent. It involves marketing, hr, growth, customer support. More developed ecosystems like Berlin, London, Stockholm even - for not talking about NY and SF - have score of people working in tech, in one role of the other. This alone creates an entire awareness of where the future is. It forces people to consider the skills that are in high demand and creates an entire generation of potential founders or executives for new startups.</p>

<p>The lack of a tech industry is also the lack of modern middle size companies that are open and willing to innovate. This is particularly important for new startups that need early adopters for their products. B2B startups in Copenhagen are faced by the dilemma of serving the local enterprises with the entire burden of super-long sales cycles, layers of approval and fear of change, or go straight into to the UK or US “modern SMB market”. This puts us at real disadvantage compared to places where you first ten customer (or at least beta users) are all within a block from your office.</p>

<h2>Too many suits</h2>

<p>Large companies in the city are jumping en masse on the startup wagon. They have the illusion that innovation is something you can appoint an agency to do or you can achieve by sponsoring events, running incubators and maybe making some investments. </p>

<p>It is no coincidence that innovation in tech has always come from startups. There is something cultural about it that has nothing to do with ping pong tables, but with the way risks are taken, the way “waste” is allowed to spread and how (little) the entire process is managed. I haven’t see any of it in the many corporate “digitalisation” programs in town. And no, mobilpay is not enough proof of the contrary.</p>

<p>What you see instead is this:</p><p>        <div class="posthaven-gallery" id="posthaven_gallery[1105755]">
                  <p class="posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed">
          <img class="posthaven-gallery-image" src="https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1785132/pZco72vBP9nYMf8hv4dTVOAhSHw/IMG_3851.JPG" />
        </p>

        </div>
</p>

<p>Everything I am trying to convey in one sentence. Take off your jacket, loosen 2 buttons and you have a startup. With a single strike you insult the people that are working hard on your core business and you perpetuate all the wrong cliques about startups. </p>

<h2>Too many politicians</h2>

<p>Why when you think of Silicon Valley you never, ever, can think of a politician associated with it?</p>

<p>I believe there is a clear role for politics (for policy actually) to create the conditions for an ecosystems to prosper. The main rule: get out of the way. The second rule: work a lot in the background to remove obstacles. Make it easier to recruit from abroad, make it cheaper to live, rent, start, go bust. Finance universities and research programs (if you want) but don’t set any specific goal. Let waste and spillovers take the turn they like. Invest in serendipity.</p>

<p>There are too many politicians willing to claim their spot on the stage. Too many grand plans of becoming “the capital of xyz”. Lots of words, few facts.</p>

<h2>Bright spots</h2>

<h3>Some foreigners will stay</h3>

<p>Go to any tech company larger than 10 people and you will clearly see the pattern. &gt;50% of them come from abroad. Copenhagen is an amazing place to stay and despite serious issues with living costs and lack of rentals (and the weather, maybe) it’s a place where most people would be happy to settle. If we avoid committing suicide by making it even harder to bring, and keep, people from outside, we stand a chance to at least attract the talent we lack. </p>

<h3>Universities reclaiming a space</h3>

<p>At Founders we are guilty of not having been close enough with the local universities, in particular DTU. But even from a detached position it is easy to see that there is plenty of potential. The new wave in technology, particularly around the (often overhyped) fields of Machine Learning and AI, will require deeper skills than “simpler” web applications of the past. Technical universities in the city have the resources and structure to play an important role. I don’t believe that people attending Standford are necessarily much better, is what they get there, and the inspiration around them, that makes most of the difference. </p>

<h3>Some good companies are obviously being built</h3>

<p>I won’t make names to avoid forgetting somebody but we all know which companies I am thinking about. Companies reaching that 50+ size where things start getting more stable, where you can train people properly, where it’s easier to enter if you come straight from school are the lifeblood of a real tech ecosystem. At Founders we are trying to play our part and although none of the companies we co-started are at that size yet, by pooling resources and building an infrastructure around them we are gradually reaching that scale. </p>

<h2>Suggestions</h2>

<p>I’ll round off with 2 suggestions, knowing that there is a lot more to be done and a lot is being done as I write.</p>

<h3>Recognise real successes, also beyond tech</h3>

<p>Too often we make the mistake of considering tech the “elite” of the city entrepreneurial movement, even when the results are so-so. When I look at “real” businesses being built, however, retail is beating us big time. Tiger and Joe &amp; The Juice are two examples successful businesses growing fast and rapidly expanding abroad. They might not have the “inevitability” or the glamour that tech has these days but they have something to teach all of us when it comes to winning. And that’s what matters. Let’s tell winner stories and let’s learn from them.</p>

<h3>Make it easier to import talent</h3>

<p>I cannot repeat myself enough. We need to import talent from abroad and we need to make it easier. Visa application, relocation, accommodation, schooling for children. All this can be done much better. Just think about the absurd CPR-address-bank account catch 22 situation every foreigner needs to go through (don’t know what I am talking about? just ask you foreign colleague). </p>

<p>We can also make it cheaper. Living costs, and by reflex salaries, are very high. Building a successful company requires an initial process of testing and failing. And that initial phase needs to be as cheap as possible. The fact that the only real tax break on employees is restricted to “highly paid employees” is a clear sign that we put attention in “maintenance” of existing companies and not on the creation of new ones. </p>

<hr><p>You might say I am seeing the glass half-empty. Maybe. But the difference between a wannabe and a real tech ecosystem is also about stop pretending to be one.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><div>I remember 2016. Lots of famous people died that year. There was David Bowie, and then that other one, and Fidel Castro. Generations are a funny thing. People are born everyday and yet it seemed baby boomers were all dying at once.<br>
</div>

<p>They would have never believed how things were about to change. Democracy seemed such a stable feature of the western world. I guess that’s just what happens when you get used to things. </p>

<p>What do you say? Why didn’t we do anything about it? You really don’t have a clue, do you? </p>

<p>— -- </p>

<p>I’ll have to go back to the nineties, before your were born. Progress seemed unstoppable. No more communism, no more nuclear risk, just trade, business and money. There were a few people who didn’t agree. Mostly old nostalgic leading a bunch of wannabe rebels with nothing better to do than trashing some windows in Seattle. Couldn’t they see that globalisation was for the poor? </p>

<p>Anyways, the combo dot-com 9/11 was the first big shake. The moment the rope we were all climbing with start cracking. We would only notice some years later. </p>

<p>The majority of us shrugged it off pretty fast. Times were good and loans were easy. Then 2008, another crash. This time the rope snapped, those behind were left back. No chance to catch up. No summit for them, not in this life. </p>

<p>—</p>

<p>What happened next is more complicated. I remember being in New York, how it all felt so great. I cursed myself for missing that train: “the best time to be alive”, someone said. It was a tale of two worlds. On one side unemployment, frustration, rage. On the other you couldn’t go to a fucking meetup without getting at lest three offers, two for jobs and one for an investment. “In case you start a company, you never know”. Euphoria and despair. </p>

<p>Then despair won. What do you expect when the majority of people feels neglected, derided, scared? What do you think they will vote? And yet again, we didn’t notice at first. Elections over we all turned back to our jobs, we had stuff to do, we were too busy to pay attention. </p>

<p>I guess London was the first spark. They had started deporting people, literally. Even if you were married to a local it didn’t matter. “No job, no stay” was their slogan, or some idiocy like that. The first big manifestation was huge. Londoners walking as one, protesting against a UK government they didn’t recognise. I swear to God somebody said there were even some Russians in the crowd, the fear of losing their townhouse stronger than allegiance to the political line back home.</p>

<p>It just didn’t matter. We were all upset, indignation was the big word, what a loser choice. Nothing mattered, not the headlines, not the strikes, not the protests from every single business unable to hire the talent they needed, or to retain the one they had. The economy kept spiralling down but they just didn’t care. They were accusing us of boycotting the national economy. Treason toward the fatherland. The economy security act won by a landslide at the referendum. </p>

<p>—</p>

<p>People in tech were the first to do something. Imagine going to work every day knowing that everything you do ends up against everything you believe in. Some started to quit already back in 2016. At first it was only a few, easily replaced. With fewer jobs around, finding an engineer that didn’t care wasn’t so difficult. </p>

<p>They called themselves “the resistance”. Weird things started happening. A few accounts disappeared. Puff, vanished, just like that. There were protests, people wanted to see some heads rolling. Nationalisation wasn’t a taboo word anymore. The big 5 went out publicly to confirm their pledge to neutrality. And yet the sabotages became more frequent. </p>

<p>The day the network went down will be remembered for long time. A new Bastille, some said. Except it was the opposite. Something did remind of France though, for a moment it seemed they would cut that boy’s head. The police came storming, two hundred were arrested, fifty went straight to death row. The toy was broken and there was nowhere to hide. </p>

<p>— </p>

<p>It is probably then that we started changing our mind. There was no hope in elections. They were just too many, just too angry. But we owned everything. We owned the banks, we owned the tech, the owned the culture. We owned the cities for Christ’s sake. </p>

<p>The army you say? Oh, come on.. They have always been where the power is. And what could they do anyway? Their drones, their intelligence, their satellites. It’s all software. We owned the whole goddam software and yet there we were, subjugated by our own government, a government we didn’t want, which didn’t understand us, which was trying to take it all away from us. Should we have let that happen?</p>

<p>If democracy was the price to pay, so be it. </p>

<p>—</p>

<p>It was a nasty business. Our great “liberation war”. I hate the name too. But a war nevertheless. You couldn’t believe the riots, the looting, the unimaginable violence. The curfew was established in December. Martial law on Boxing day. I don’t think the world had seen a bloodiest Christmas. Even during WWI they had stopped to play football. But we had no time for football. Revenge what was we had time for. </p>

<p>—</p>

<p>Why are looking at me like that. What do you want from me? What would you have done? </p>

<p>You should thank me. We did’t all for you. </p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Many people today believe that democracy is at risk. Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, the UK “Brexit” vote (and its aftermath), the shadow of Marine Le Pen in France and the general rise of populist movements across Europe, are taken as signs that support for traditional liberal democratic values is declining. <a href="http://http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/world/americas/western-liberal-democracy.html?_r=0" target="_blank" title="Link: http://http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/world/americas/western-liberal-democracy.html?_r=0">Other data points seem to suggest a similar trend</a><a href="http://http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/world/americas/western-liberal-democracy.html?_r=0" target="_blank">.</a></p>

<p>An ultimate fight seems ready to be staged between so-called “New nationalists” and liberal “internationalist” elites:</p>

<p><i>“Let’s call it the New Nationalism: a bitter populist rejection of the status quo that global elites have imposed on the international system since the Cold War ended, and which lower-income voters have decided—understandably—is unfair.” <a href="http://http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/nationalism-donald-trump-boris-johnson-brexit-foreign-policy-xenophobia-isolationism-213995" target="_blank">Politico</a></i></p><a href="http://http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/nationalism-donald-trump-boris-johnson-brexit-foreign-policy-xenophobia-isolationism-213995" target="_blank">

</a><p>I share these fears, but there is another scenario that receives much less attention and which is equally disturbing. What if the biggest threat for democracy didn’t come from the populists and <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/nationalism-donald-trump-boris-johnson-brexit-foreign-policy-xenophobia-isolationism-213995">nationlists</a> but from the opposite side? </p>

<p>Last weak I wrote<a href="http://stefanozorzi.xyz/1112141http://"> a short story</a> to show how that might happen. It was a deliberate exercise in fiction, very aware that anything of that kind is highly improbable. </p>

<p>Improbable, not impossible. </p>

<h2>The threatened minority</h2>

<p>In its essence, my short foray into fiction shows how the global minority of internationalists could tip over to the temptation of using its power (economic and technological) to stop the rise of nationalists and their policies. </p>

<p>Dystopian fiction consists in taking certain visible signs of the present to their extreme consequences. Like solving a labyrinth backwards, it shows the path to a specific end. Except that here we are not trying to get there. </p>

<h3>Polarisation and weakening of national ties</h3>

<p>We have rarely been so politically polarised. When this happened in the past, it didn’t turn out well. Polarised societies can stick together when a strong underlying sense of unity survives [2]. That sense of “oneness” is weakening today under the impact of technology and international mobility which makes the internationalist class less attached to national values than in the past. People in London, New York, Berlin, Barcelona and Copenhagen feel closer to each other than to their fellow countrymen in the periphery. </p>

<p>The more we look at the political debates, and at the discussions on social media, the more the opposite poles seem far apart. We might still speak the same language and cheer for the same team when national football is on TV, but we understand each other less and less and we show worrying signs of contempt toward each others. </p>

<h3>Feeling of impotence</h3>

<p>Within the context of a polarised nation state, internationalist are almost everywhere a minority. They feel now hostage of an angry mob that can use its electoral weigh to push reactionary policies. Manifestations in London after Brexit and in NY after Trump could just be the beginning.</p>

<p>Two more factors add to the feeling of impotence. Many internationalists are not citizens of the countries where they live and work, and therefore don’t enjoy any political representation (the real disenfranchised). In addition, there is a widespread feeling that facts and objectivity have lost importance. The vaccination debate is emblematic in this sense, socialmedia-reinforced beliefs are so strong that even the most obvious facts seem impossible to push through. Civilised argumentation feels increasingly futile. </p>

<p>Watch the clip below for a similar example. </p>

<p><iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9DEdpTIXuro?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>[2]</p>

<h3>Economic influence</h3>

<p>While in the national political arena internationalists are increasingly marginalised and frustrated, their economic dominance has never been greater. </p>

<p>Nationalists have always found an easy target for their propaganda in the “global financial class”. In the past however, this group had relatively little influence in the economy. Fascism in particular was able to gather the bulk of the economic forces behind its banner, with the promise of industry-friendly protectionist and anti-union policies. </p>

<p>Today, national economies are much more dependent on global trade and finance. Cities, and the internationalists that inhabit them, have a disproportionate economic power, despite their political status of minority. </p>

</blockquote></p>

<h3>Technology</h3>

<p>Even more important is the role played by technology, and technologists, the vast majority of which are within the internationalist ranks. </p>

<p>This is the defining element of this clash. A potentially marginalised minority (at political level) controls the ultimate levers of our society, across culture, media, retail and even military. </p>

<p>The recent fake news debate and the call on Facebook and Google to impose a sort of censorship on them shows how explosive this situation could become. Only recently, people in technology have been waking up to a situation where their job is not only neutral to some of the most problematic developments in society, but it’s likely causing them (or at least accelerating them). We have seen the first defections, on a personal level, and more might happen. </p>

<h2>Exit vs voice</h2>

<p>A way to look at how the situation might evolve is through the lenses of “Exit” and “Voice” [3]. A few observers, among which Balaji Srinivasan, believe in “exit” as the likely choice for internationalists. </p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Over the next decade, internationalists will lose control of the state to nationalists. They will then turn to global technology instead.</p>— Balaji S. Srinivasan (@balajis) <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/746543681079914496">June 25, 2016</a>
</blockquote></p>

<p>Strengthening individual freedoms, facilitating international mobility and, in general, allowing people to “vote with their feet” is always a good thing. But the possibility of exit as a realistic scenario is questionable. Physical exit (actually moving) remains a difficult choice for many (assuming there is even a country that wants you). Technology exit (individual freedom through technology) is an interesting idea, but in the present state of affairs a bad government can still ruin your life regardless of the fact that you have the internet. Too much of your life is still offline. [4] </p>

<p>The issue with exit, in addition, is that it often leads to an even worse situation for those that stay behind. It is a legitimate choice, but a selfish one.[5]</p>

<p>The alternative to exit is voice, and with the electoral way potentially barred for a long time (remember, this is a pessimistic scenario) violent voice is not to be excluded a priori. Especially when we consider that <a href="http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Foa%26Mounk-27-3.pdf">only 19 of millennials in the US believe it would be illegitimate</a> for the military to take over if the government is incompetent.</p>

<h2>Comparisons</h2>

<p>It is interesting, at this point, to turn briefly to history and compare the present situation with similar ones in the past. Can we find examples of progressive minorities abandoning democracy to protect their status? And if not, why? </p>

<p>The ascent of neo-nationalism is often compared with the early years of facism in Italy and nazism in Germany. Also then it all started with an anti-establishment protest, targeting a minority of cosmopolitan and internationalist “elites”. That minority, though, simply didn’t have sufficient economic and cultural leverage. Economic power was firmly connected to the land (and the people) and it didn’t take much to align national interests with business interests. </p>

<p>More recently, and on the opposite side of the ideological spectrum, populist movements in Venezuela and, partly, Bolivia have also failed to provoke a violent reaction from the democratic opposition (although a coup was attempted in Venezuela in 2002). While in this case economic power was clearly opposed to the ruling majority, the possibility of “exit “<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904491704576573051332461710">(mostly to the US)</a> provided a real alternative to the use of “voice”.</p>

<p>Digging further, the only case where a democratically elected anti-elite movement was met with a violent un-democratic response is probably Chile in 1973. The difference here is that Allende never had the support of the majority of the population. On the other side, it is also difficult to argue that the social base behind Pinochet was democratic in the first place. </p>

<h2>Anecdotes</h2>

<p>This entire post (and the short story that inspired it) has been a rather theoretical exercise, exploring the possibility of a violent, undemocratic, reaction from the internationalist elite to the growing populist wave. </p>

<p>It is obvious that such a scenario is unlikely, as we have not even reached the point where a neo-nationalist victory can be ascertained. Even in its remote likelihood, it provides another good reason why we should do all we can to prevent slipping further down the black hole of a complete nationalist take over.</p>

<p>I’d like to conclude listing just a few tweets that kickstarted my fantasy and brought me to think of this. Nothing to worry about, it’s just a few isolated anecdotes… </p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote></p>

<p>— </p>

<p>[1]Post-war Italy is a good example where a country deeply split between communists and christian democrats managed to stick together. This was made possible by the presence of unifying elements: a fresh memory of the resistance to fascism which saw both groups fighting together (not without issues), a strong patriotic feeling, a full commitment within the party elites to the democratic constitution. </p>

<p>[2] My point is not to take position on the specific exchange in the clip. We could debate the misinformation of the 5 Trump voters but also the contempt that transpire from the anchor. Both reinforce my points above: these people have nothing in common and would gladly not have to live under the same roof/country. Yet they have to.</p>

<p>[3] Introduced by Alber Hirscham with his “Exit, Voice and Loyalty”. The basic concept is the following: when members of a group (e.g. a country) see their condition worsening, they have two options, “exit” (leaving, defecting) or “voice” (attempt to fix, oppose). </p>

<p>[4] In some cases the opposite is happening. People “exit” by leaving Facebook and/or Twitter. </p>

<p>[5] The typical examples is that of middle class parents withdrawing their children to public schools. This deprives that school of the constituency (middle class parents) which is often more vocal about the school’s problems and leave the remaining children in an even worse situation. Hirschman himself reached the point, obviously extreme, of regretting leaving Germany in the 1930’s. </p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>When I was young I had my parents build me a laboratory in our garage. Every week I would go to an electronic repair store in my street and beg for some broken radio, tv or small home appliance I could take home and dismantle. So many times I asked if I could work in that store. It was my dream, but it was too dangerous. I was 9, and I was a geek. </p>

<p>At school I was good in math, I would get bored and got myself kicked out of classes quite often. In high school I aced physics and thought about studying astronomy once I would get to college. </p>

<p>I ended up studying Political Science, majoring in History of India and writing my final dissertation on the relationship between a small tribe inhabiting the north-western part of the country and the traditional rulers. </p>

<p>——</p>

<p>Willian Gibson said once that all cultural change is essentially technology driven. We shape our tools and our tools shape us. Over the last 30 odd years, generously the time I have been alive, we have built the tools of our information age. First the computer, then the web. And boy did they shape us. </p>

<p>During this time, being in technology has been the right choice. “On the right side of history”, as it is often said. It has been one of those epochs where finding yourself in the right place, and at the right time, could really make a difference. Even at smaller scale, you can roughly split the people you know by whether they are part of the new world or the old one. </p>

<p>The ability to manipulate technology is a superpower. A secret key to a white canvas begging to be painted. It hasn’t been about permission, or title, but about skills, courage and, more than we actually realise, naivety. </p>

<p>——</p>

<p>Technology has now penetrated every aspect of our life. Like water finding its way through the cracks of a stone wall, a few drops at first, soon a full stream. What we considered immutable is now all up in the air. </p>

<p>Talking about a tech world and a real world today make much less sense. But so is the opposite. Vekatesh Rao said it right a couple of days ago: “It doesn’t matter if you are not interested in politics. Politics is interested in you.” </p>

<p>Our white canvas is now society. Technology is the paint but not the painting. How we will work, how we will create and redistribute value, how we will organise ourselves. These are all open questions that beg to be answered in a new way. </p>

<p>Reforming society will be the new hacking. </p>

<p>——</p>

<p>I think a lot about my choices now that I work in technology. Would it have been better to follow my scientific inclination? When did I stop being a geek? </p>

<p>The truth is I never did. I remember when I decided to pursue a different path. Curiosity drew me to people, countries, decisions and errors more that it drew me towards machines and equations. </p>

<p>I wanted to find out why things looked broken in so many parts of our world. How did we get where we are? How do we go where we want to be?</p>

<p>Breaking an old TV apart was my way to find out how stuff worked. The attitude matters more than that topic. </p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>When it comes to complicated problems - the ones that don’t bend themselves to unequivocal answers - the first solution coming to our mind is often a poor one. </p>

<p>Another sign that we are on the wrong path is when a lot of other people, of similar tastes and inclinations, agree with us. We can go as far as extrapolating a rule: any widely shared view on a complicated matter is likely to be wrong. There is a simple explanation for this: none of us has time to think deeply about all possible topics. We are wired to take shortcuts and settle on a position that appears coherent with pre-defined world views. Coherent, simple, and wrong. </p>

<p>A bit of trickery can do magic when we fall prey to this form of “common talk”. For example, we can take up the opposite position in a debate and let our (dialectical) opponent do the work for us. If we are lucky, we might learn something we don’t know and walk away with renewed conviction. </p>

<p>More often, we will only hear back the same argument we set off to challenge. The advantage is that we have now made it “their” position. We have externalised it. We have gained perspective. This allows us to spot logical fallacies, incongruences and false assumptions. </p>

<p>It’s a painfully refreshing experience. Armed with a better understanding of our biases we can now embark in our quest for clarity. </p></div>]]></content:encoded>

It is a beautiful painting of a world in transition: from the post-napoleonic restoration until the carnage of WWI, passing through 1848, the Commune, electrification, railways and industrial production. Possibly the biggest transformation ever experienced by man, and comparable to the one we are living today. <br></p><p>It is also a story of innovation and innovators. Of a group of painters that defy all conventions to follow their artistic instinct and impose an entire new approach to visual arts. They weren't received well. A reporter for Le Figaro wrote about the first exhibition of their work:</p><blockquote><p><i>"The innocent pedestrian, attracted by the flags put up outside, goes in to have a look. But what a crule spectable meets his frightened eyes! Five or six lunatics -one of them a woman-  make up a group of poor wretches who have succumbed to the madness of ambition [...] Some people are content to laugh at such things. But it makes me sad at heart."</i></p></blockquote><p>and here is another one, from La Presse:</p><blockquote><p><i>"...the practitioner falls into a senseless confusion, completely mad, grotesque and, fortunately, without precedent i the annals of art. For it is nothing less than the negation of the most elementary rules of drawing and painting [...] one is inclined to wonder if there has not been a deliberate attempt to mystify the public."</i></p></blockquote><p>All other reviews follow the same pattern: shock, disgust, and laughter. <br></p><p>It is the inevitable faith of all real innovators to be laughed at. To be dismissed as jokers, lunatics, people that have lost touch with reality. It reminded me about the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJku_CSyNghttp://" target="_blank">"what's this internet thing" </a>video.  . There was also another video, which I cannot find now, where Steve Jobs is introduced by the host dismissively as a "computer geek". </p><p>Today, founders and investors of technology startups are seldom laughed at. On the contrary, they are celebrated and revered as the saviours of our time. They have gone from villain to heroes, even before proving much about what they are doing. The tables are turned and nobody wants to be the fool on youtube who laughed about the internet. </p><p>But there is something missing here. Who are the <b>true</b> innovators, who is being laughed at today? </p><p>I keep asking myself this question, and I don't have a definite answer. </p><p>Beside their increasing popularity, bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies (or the solutions they enable) might fit in to this picture. People skipping the conventional fund raising circuit and issuing their own tokens instead. A handful of visionaries that dare to imagine a future free from centralised sources of power, money and data. </p><p>There are also the "common" men and women working in larger corporations or in public services. The "incumbent" are laughed at all the time. </p><p>I never feel at ease when people laugh about something or someone too much. </p><div><br></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Jeremy Liew is the man these days, his 500k investment in Snapchat will likely go down as one of the best venture deal ever. Reflecting on this success, he observed how innovation, at least when it comes to consumer tech, is being democratised. Silicon Valley's monopoly on technology is weakening and another powerful force of innovation is emerging as a source of competitive advantage: insight into popular culture. </p><p>In his definition, this refers to people's interests and preferences, their emotions and habits. At a higher level, it points to a rebalancing in the relationship between theory and empirical observation, between intellectual elaborations and common sense. It reminded me of a comment Peter Thiel made in a recent interview: "I think often the smarter people are more prone to trendy, fashionable thinking because they can pick up on things, they can pick up on cues more easily, and so they’re even more trapped by it than people of average ability."</p><p>It is something I feel on myself very often. Faced with a situation I want to understand, I sense the weigh of established knowledge clouding my thoughts. In these moments, ignorance can be bliss. Simply ignoring what smarter people said about a certain topic allows us to get to a really personal understanding and we are often surprised about the simplicity of our conclusions, to the point we start doubting them again. </p><p>The right heuristic here is that simplicity is the normal condition of right conclusions. It is a topic I will write more about, soon. </p><p><br></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>"Focus on the journey" is an old idea that can be found in most ancient philosophies. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna exhorts Arjuna to focus on his action, not on the fruits:</p><blockquote><p><i>"You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction."</i></p></blockquote><p>Seneca says something similar in on of his letters when he writes: <br></p><blockquote><p><i>"Attalus philosophus dicere solebat iucundius esse amicum facere quam habere, quomodo artifici iucundius pingere est quam pinxisse" - The phylosopher Attalus used to say that making friends is as enjoyable than having them, just like for the painter, painting is more important than having painted. </i></p></blockquote><p>More recently, Bill Walsh, the famous 49ers coach, used to say that "the score takes care of itself", referring to the importance of daily practice and attitude in achieving results in the field when game-time came. </p><p>I have always liked this way of thinking, to the point of making the Seneca one my motto. It is important however to understand it correctly. The right interpretation is about mental energy and focus. Once you have established your goal, all you have to do is making sure that you put in the right behaviour. That's the only variable you really control. Are you performing, day after day, week after week, the actions that are most likely to eventually lead to your goal? Or are you stressing about not being able to achieve it and looking for shortcuts? </p><p>Every writer knows that the only way to complete a book is to sit down in front of the blank paper or screen everyday and write. Putting in the hours is the only true way writing gets done. So does the football player. Come to practice, perform, live a healthy life, the score will take care of itself. </p><p>The wrong interpretation is to believe that process alone will tell you what to do. That you can apply a rational step-by-step process to define your goal and to live your life. In sports the goal is given. It's the championship, the super bowl, whatever your sport has. In life and business it is less clear. Our first step should be to define our goal, who do we want to be? what do we want to achieve? The next one is to understand what actions are needed to get there. Can you achieve your goal without putting in the right amount of hours? Can you do it without sleeping well, eating well, letting your mind wander around sometime? The right actions will ofter feel to have the least short term impact on the goal. That's the difficult part, to put the goal aside once we have defined it. To forget any form of short term thinking and optimisation. </p><p>Every day, do what you are supposed to do, and enjoy the ride. <br></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>We talk a lot about ambition in our business. Having some is a prerequisite to start something. To do anything, really. But how much should you have?</p><p>Investors often pass on founders for lack of ambition. Entire businesses are considered "low-ambition" or, to use a word that I hate, "lifestyle". </p><p>I consider myslef ambitious, and I do look for ambition in others. But of a specific kind. </p><p>I don't care about world domination, about market size (in general), about power. The ambition I like is the ambition of doing something that wasn't possibile before. What can you do today that you couldn't do yesterday ? What is uniquely possible on the internet that wasn't possible in an analog world? </p><p> I meet often people that have seen a business opportunity, an idea to make money of something. I respect that,  but excuse me if I am not excited. </p><p>I started thinking about this while listening to Jan Erik from Mapillary. What they are doing is the type of ambition I am taking about. The right kind.</p><p><br></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Considering the future</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Tyler Cowen has an unpublished book out there called <a href="http://https://medium.com/stubborn-attachments/stubborn-attachments-full-text-8fc946b694d#.8mk71vh26" target="_blank">Stubborn Attachment</a>. In it, he makes the case for the "imperative of growth". No, it is not about startups, it is about the economy.  </p><p>Economic growth is a powerful force which has shown incredible healing properties in human history. Nothing cures inequality, poverty, unemployment, more than growth. In lack of growth we are destined to a troublesome epoch, with people and nations fighting over limited resources. I must add that growth here is attached to a broader concept of wealth, defined as "wealth plus": the total amount of value produced over some period, including leisure time, household production and environmental amenities. Growth should be our first and main objective, subordinated only to few universal human rights. </p><p>What I like the most about this thesis is the moral principle that sustains it. Namely that we should care about the future at least as much as we care about the present. In the business world we are used to discounting the future. To compare present benefits and future ones we apply a rate of discount that puts an extra burden on our future gains. In traditional business accounting (and often in our private lifes) we procrastinate long term investments in favour of short term results. This leads to a dangerous way of thinking: </p><blockquote><p><i>"Why should costs and benefits receive less weight, simply because they are further in the future? When the future comes, these benefits and costs will be no less real. Imagine finding out that you, having just reached your twenty-first birthday, must soon die of cancer because one evening Cleopatra wanted an extra helping of dessert. How could this be justified?"</i></p></blockquote><p>In politics, this is reflected by the fact that people of the future are not represented. They are a silent constituency. While political choices (at least we would hope) have a great impact on the people who will come after us, nothing of their preferences and agenda is included in the political debate. As recent electoral results have shown, older age groups have the power to basically fuck up the future for younger generations. </p><p>I like the idea that we should challenge this principle. Why should the present be as valued as the future (when not more)? Why should someone who is only going to live on a fraction of the consequences have the ability to decide for everyone else? Shouldn't we weigh our votes in a way that better represents who is going to stick around longer? </p><p>It sounds like blasphemy. Many will jump off their chairs, pointing fingers at the disrespect for the elders, and maybe bringing the example of traditional societies. Well, traditional societies have always had mechanisms to give formal power and status to the elders, very often as an illusion of power. Our electoral democracies have made this into an a false absolute, "one head one vote", which implicitly assigns more value to the present than the future. It might be time to consider a change. It is time to consider the future.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>I was listening to Andreas Mattsson presenting how Spotify's uses machine learning to recommend music. A fascinating topic, but what struck me was how interesting and challenging and rewarding must have been for Andreas and the team to work on this problem. Successful companies are made successful in large part by the people who work there. In many cases, employees-led initiatives result in the biggest breakthrough for a company. Just let people follow their curiosity and see magic happen. </p><p>Sergei Brin pointed to the same magic when he told the story about how Google's Brain team became a fundamental part of the company: "Jeff Dean would periodically come up to me and say, 'Look, the computer made a picture of a cat,' and I said 'OK that's very nice, Jeff' … and fast forward a few years and now Brain probably touches every single one of our main projects."</p><p>I think of this as the fun-to-work-on effect. Similar to other types of network effects, it is a self-reinforcing loop that makes companies and teams stronger. A small group of people starts working on something. That something grows and begins touching more and more interesting problems. The volume of data available increases and even more problems can now be solved and explored. People start joining your team because they want to solve interesting problems. Once they are there, their curiosity leads them to uncover even more possibilities, and so on.  </p><p>The biggest part of any company's success comes from the drive, curiosity and ingenuity of the people working there. Create a company where it is not only fun to work IN, but where there are enough problems that are fun to work ON. The rest will probably take care of itself. </p><div><br></div><p><br></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>I was watching some x-factor with my daughter which led us to some Elvis videos which then made me think of Johnny Cash. I had a mess to clean up in the kitchen and I decided to put "I walk the line", the movie, in the background. What a story. </p><p>The first thing you'll notice is Memphis. Why Memphis? At every turn in history, there are cities that count more than others. Paris was like that for painting between mid 19th century until right after WWII. Memphis was it for music in the 50' and 60'. Elvis, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and many others. Some cities are just the place where things happen. </p><p>You'll also see Johnny's first wife, Vivian, worrying about her husband's fantasies. Difficult to blame her, nine out of ten she would be right. He should take that job in San Antonio and stop wasting time on his band, with those "two mechanics that can hardly play". He should have. But he didn't.</p><p>There is then the scene when Johnny Cash does his first audition. At first, he does what many do: playing someone else's tune. He wants to fit in, he wants to conform. Luckily Sam Philips was there. The kind of guy who knows how to push people to do what they are meant to. Johnny was not meant to play the usual gospel, he was meant to play his thing: "I got a couple of songs  I wrote in the Air Force. You got anything against the Air Force?.. I do". And so it starts. </p><p>If you have watched the movie you know the rest. If you haven't, go watch it now. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

Today, there is a lot of talk about what this thing could be, the usual suspects being AI, voice, AR/VR and blockchain, in its various shapes and forms. </p><p>I was very happy when I met two young guys, barely out of their bachelor, this weekend. With pure excitement in their eyes, they were explaining to me why they are working on ethereum: "This is by far the most interesting technology of our times". I agree. </p><p>I am no future teller, and this is a wish as much as it is a prediction, but there are too many reasons why young people should be looking in this direction. We need a new architecture of the web. We need to re-distribute ownership to the nodes. We need to improve security and create better opportunities for capturing value at the edge. Blockchain, bitcoin, ethereum and all their syblings are our best bet in this direction. Flawed, for sure. Exciting, you bet it. </p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>When you learn a new language you gain more than the ability to communicate with people from a different place. Languages do not overlap 1 to 1, each word on one side corresponding to one on the other. They stack on top of each other irregularly, leaving you with a larger vocabulary made of new words and new idioms. Your sensorial surface grows, you can feel new things. </p><p>Families speaking multiple languages at once often seems to be mixing them regularly. We do it all the time. It is not a symptom of confusion, of incomplete knowledge. It is the advantage of pulling from multiple sources to convey a message. Each language has a number of critical expressions that you don't find in the other. They exist in your mind, in your perception, but you can't truly feel them before you learn that new word. </p><p>I read this paragraph last night: </p><blockquote><p><i>"Perhaps a writer would think of the monosyllables and lack of grammatical inflection in Chinese, and of how this would sound next to lovely long Finnish words all double letters &amp; long vowels in 14 cases or lovely Hungarian all prefixes suffixes, &amp; having first thought of that would then think of some story about Hungarians or Finns with Chinese."*</i></p></blockquote><p>That's how my life often feels. That's also what life at Founders office feels. </p><p>Languages are also more than words. Danish, for example, is extremely phonetical. Every person who has tried to learn it has felt the pain of having more knowledge in our head than what we can get understood. You think you know that word, but they keep not getting what you are trying to say. It frustrated the hell out of me. Couldn't they at least try?! Truth is they just don't understand what you say. Mispronounced words are non-words. </p><p>It's interesting how this affects how the language itself is thought to young children. My daughter has just started school and she learning to read. But you can't read Danish as you would read Italian, stringing together the sounds of each letter into a full word. You need to know what an entire word sounds like before you can read it. You need to spot it on the page, recollect what word it is (by it signs) and then say it as it is pronounced, in one go. The way to do it is to start with very short words. So she comes home with these short books written entirely with two-letter words. It is a funny constraint if you think about it. How does the writer come up with a story written only combining two-letter words? That's when you get a cow (kø) drinking beer (øl). Creativity is also about that. </p><p>* In "The last samurai", by Helen DeWitt</p><p><br></p><p><br></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Welcome to this world. You were born on the 27th of February 2017, just as darkness was making room for the day. You are a son of Europe. Italian father, Icelandic mother, born in Denmark. You still have no documents, no "papers". You will get a passport soon, so you can travel. Actually, you will get two, just not the one from the country you live in. It will seem stupid to have 2, maybe 3, passports. Aren't you just a boy, with a mother a father and living in a place? </p><p>This is not how things used to be, and we don't know if it is how things will be as you grow up. Your great grandmother was born in one of those turf houses you see in the tourist brochures about Iceland. Animals living on the ground floor, to warm the house. They read a lot even back then, she went on being a writer of children books, and giving birth to two sons. </p><p>My granddad was born in the Austro-Hungarian empire. There is no empire today, but the city he was born in is the same where I grew up. He was 11 when the first war ended, and fought in the second one. It took him six months to come back from the Baltic sea, big part on foot. He walked in a town of rubble, just to learn his twin brother had died the year before. It's quite a lucky event that I exist, and you too. These are the kind of stories you hear today if you are from China, India and a few other places. These are good stories. </p><p>We live well today and we owe most of it to those who came before us. I am before you, and I'll do all I can to not fuck it up. </p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>I am always fascinated by the trail of inspiration leading from one idea to the other. The invisible thread that weaves books with articles with podcasts with experiences with travels with exhibitions with presentations. Even with business ideas. </p><p>Considering how much I read and how long I have been using amazon, I am often surprised how ineffective its recommendation engine is on me. It might help that I have been sharing account with my wife for 15 years, and now with my daughter - I guess it confuses the hell out of it - but it is more than that. </p><p>Recommendation engines try to infer what I will read next looking at my history and at what people like me have been reading. Even for data monsters like Amazon, they rely on internal knowledge: me and my reading habits, other people and their reading habits. It is better than nothing, and obviously quite effective looking at the success of these players, but incomplete. Most inspirations come from external sources: a friend's recommendation, an article you have read, a cue within one of the previous book, a movie you have watched. Looking at books alone, you can trace a path from one to the other and you can maybe try to anticipate what the next one will be based on the trajectory. But you will always be blind to what happened in between. </p><p>I have always wanted to keep a log of this path. A sort of Ariadne's thread on which to weave the pearls I find along my life. I have begun working on it, starting from what I am currently reading and going backwards until my memory assists me. I ll post a link to it soon. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Mediocrity, gravity and automation</title>
      <link>http://stefanozorzi.xyz/mediocrity-gravity-and-automation</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Mar 2017 07:19:23 +0000</pubDate>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Is there a role for mediocrity? and should we protect it? In a recent interview, Malcom Gladwell makes an interesting point:</p><blockquote><p><i>GLADWELL: I wonder whether making the world safe for mediocrity is not a very worthy goal of teaching, not only because the people who’ll one day be good need to pass through mediocrity on their way to being good, but also that, like I said, it’s the gateway to experimentation. </i></p></blockquote><p>I have been thinking about this a lot. When friction is removed, gravity starts working. Everything is attracted to the centre, to a few people, institutions, and companies. Their mass increases further and so does their gravitational pull. Tech's "network effects" are one manifestation of gravity. </p><p>Take the local college professor. When everybody can access the best content and lectures from the best professors in the world, who will care to listen to the local college professor? Gravity kills "average". This example displays clearly the gravity dilemma: access to the best professor is undeniably a good thing, but what about the local guy? When gravity can work unfettered there can only be a few winners. </p><p>Automation is another factor contributing to the "end of mediocrity". Jobs based on simple, repetitive tasks are the easiest to automate, but also the ones people usually start their career with. How many times have you heard about somebody starting out making copies, delivering mail, bringing coffee or arranging boxes in the warehouse? This effect will have a big impact in professions where expertise acquired through time matters. Legal associates, for example, slave on menial tasks for their all-mighty partners while earning a right to sit at the client table and learn the trade. Today, however, clients are increasingly unwilling to pay for law school grads checking spelling mistakes in contracts. And they shouldn't, a machine can do that. Associates jobs are being slashed, but this leaves a question on how firms will train the lawyer of the future (the ones required to do "human-level" jobs). </p><p>There is then a pet dilemma of mine: the supermarket self-checkout machine. We all hate it, but that's not the point. We know it is just a step towards an amazon go future. The point is the job it replaces.  Every time I go to the supermarket I can't see the social utility in replacing the cashier. It is a simple job that lends perfectly to high school students and people that would find it difficult to do anything else. I might save time (eventually) checking out by myself and the supermarket will save money (probably, and there is surely other places where more waste is allowed) but what about the high school student? what's left for them? A friend of mine pointed, rightly, to the arbitrariness of my rant. After all, how many jobs I am I trying to replace in my work at Founders? Why should the task of saving mediocrity fall on the supermarket chain? It is like reading Bill Gates arguing for a tax on robots. I mean, the man that automated more white collar tasks in the last century and, notably, created way more jobs in the process. </p><p>There are no simple answers to these questions. I definitely don't have one. I am left with the thought that there is beauty and utility in mediocrity, and we should at least consider the risk we run but killing it. I am probably sliding into nostalgia, but I cheer my memory of the summer spent licking envelopes for my uncle. It paid my interrail ticket, will basic income provide for that as well? </p><p> </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><div><br></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Every football fan knows that time is relative. If you are desperately defending your one-goal lead, every second seems an eternity. If you are trying to catch up, seconds keep gobbling minutes down. As a patological procrastinator, I should know that ten minutes never last enough when I am in a hurry. The more I speed up, the more time accelerates. </p><p>The flip side is that you can fabricate time. If you are short of it, all you need to do it is slowing down. It is one of those rules that should be easy to remember: think of the logical answer, then do the opposite. </p><p>The saying goes like this: </p><p>“You should sit in meditation for twenty minutes everyday - unless you're too busy; then you should sit for an hour.”* </p><p>Easier said than done. Yet true. <br></p><p>I found a similar example in the Upside of Stress. When people feel overwhelmed by their tasks, and can't seem to find time for anything, the best remedy is to stop what they are doing and go help someone else. It sounds like the dumbest thing to do if we are up against a tight deadline. Until we remember that time is relative, and we can simply fabricate more. </p><p>*I have never picked up meditating btw<br></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Too many people have been telling me about Chef's Table, the Netflix series, so I ended up watching a couple of episodes. What I like about stories of artists is the progression. Every artist - painter, chef, architect, writer - follows a personal path to discover her true self. Some artists are self-taught. The majority starts by being an apprentice to another artist. Chefs work in other chefs' restaurant, architects in other architects' studios. </p><p>We tend to be surprised by stories of self-taught artists, Tadao Ando formed himself on books and observations, Jeong Kwan through the daily practice of cooking in her monastery. I am even more fascinated by those who broke out from their masters. Imagine being a young artist learning from Alain Ducasse, or Rem Koolhaas. How strong their influence, how easy to be shaped in their mould. And yet they find a way to become themselves. They start by taking their master's style in their own direction, drifting slightly away from the traced path. Sometimes the rupture is violent, a total rejection. More often, it is a gradual, painful, progression: adulation, imitation, deviation, realisation. </p><p>Our life is a journey of becoming ourselves.  As soon as we are there someone else is just starting. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><br><i>"Judge not</i><br><i>Before you judge yourself</i><br><i>Judge not</i><br><i>If you are not ready for judgement"</i><div><i><br></i></div><div>
<i></i><i>Bob Marley</i><i><div><i><br></i></div></i>There are many things I am not sure about. Many ideas I am working on which are flawed. I accept that as part of what we do. Being too judgmental, too early, doesn't help in the creation of the new. Yet I often envy the clarity of thought I can have when judging others. <div><br></div>
<div>Every time I am listening to somebody else's idea, looking at a deck, discussing a strategy, I find it easy to spot issues, to suggest alternatives, to "show the way". I then turn around and look at my own stuff, always far from perfect. It sounded so easy when I was in the judging seat. A tune in my head: "Who are you to judge me and the life that I live..."  What right do I have to point fingers?</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I see where this comes from, things are always easier far from the trenches. Down in the mud, it's about the inches, the small details, the circumstances. "I stumbled". "The rifle jammed". "I couldn't see through the fog". All true. And yet we need perspective. We need someone looking from the hill, observing the entire field, head free from the noise. It's not about being perfect, everybody needs perspective. </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>We need this role play. I can judge you. I am ready for judgment. </div>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>My friend David Galbraith <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/06/europe-google-silicon-valley-digital-industryhttp://" target="_blank">talks often</a> about the lack of a meaningful European internet company. He has a point. After all, if the single largest economic area (by GDP) in the world hasn't been able to produce a truly global internet platform almost 30 years into this revolution, it is probably worth asking some questions. </p><p>The reason why we too often avoid the discussion is that it requires to bring up some uncomfortable topics. Protectionism is among those. A taboo word for many people, generally associated with xenophobic sentiment of the new right or old school nostalgia of the left. There is sufficient evidence by now that trade wars don't bring much good. There is less evidence that (some) protectionism is by the default bad. After all, most advanced nations in the industrial world got a chance to develop their own heavy and manufacturing industries at a time where infrastructure itself created some barriers to trade. Low friction means high gravity, and gravity means concentration. </p><p>After WW2, <a href="http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic925740.files/Week%203/Hirschman_Political.pdf" title="Link: http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic925740.files/Week%203/Hirschman_Political.pdf">Import-substituting industrialisation</a> became a popular term for emerging countries willing to catch up with more developed nations. The main idea was that by limiting access to foreign manufactured goods you could stimulate the birth and growth of a local industrial economy. The result was mostly disappointing. Not because goods could not be manufactured (or not with sufficient quality) but because "industrialisation" means more than just "manufacturing". We tend to associate it with a large span of social and economic changes which go well beyond what a factory can spit out.</p><p>Taken from a pure output point of view, it would be fair to say that China got the internet economy right. Better than Europe at least. By being closed to the US internet giants, it has created the condition for true native platforms to emerge. Europe, on the other hand, has assumed that industrial trade philosophy could be ported to the internet. That fighting excessive concentration could be sufficient to limit the power of internet monopolies. We all know how it went. </p><p>We are left with the question of whether a more protectionist approach to the internet would have benefitted Europe more. I don't know. At the end of the day, the same argument could be made by each European country. "Why doesn't Italy have an internet giant like (insert country of choice)??" I prefer thinking that there is a European way to the information economy. Something that fits more with our value and our heritage. We can still build that, it can be our import-substituting digitalisation. </p></div>]]></content:encoded>

Through our own sufferings and those of the people close to us. Stories are great shortcuts into empathy. Can you watch "Grave of the Fireflies" and not feel love for all the children?

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Homo Sapiens, by Nikolaus Geyrhalter, is an exceptional documentary. If you are lucky enough to catch it, you will find yourself looking at footage of abandoned places for 94 minutes straight. Not a dialogue. No soundtrack. Rain dripping through a broken ceiling, a gust of wind blowing papers around a deserted classroom, flapping of wings when a pigeon flies through an empty warehouse, croaking of a frog in an abandoned mall. </p><p>The goal is to make us feel what earth will look like once we are gone. We are told nothing about the places we see. Not a hint to why they have been abandoned, letting nature regain its ownership. Nothing about the stories, the tragedies, that forced humans away. That's not the point. It is not about the single place. We are left with the feeling that humanity is gone, forever, from everywhere. Nobody seems to bother. There is no one that could. Wind blows, frog croak. Unperturbed by the lack of us - or because of that - nature goes on with its existence. Waves crashing on the shore, birds shrieking in the sky. Who liked these people anyway? </p><p>And yet there is so much of us in the movie.  Without seeing a single living person you can still feel our presence. A symbol in a broken congress hall reminds us of wars, tragedies, broken dreams, people chanting at parades, man enchanting the masses at a rally. Computers, servers, a radio antenna pointed at the sky, tell us about our dream to conquer nature, on this world and on others. Cars, magazines, supermarket trollies, a water slide, a swing - tools for our distraction, for entertainment. You cannot miss our uniqueness, our arrogance, our ambition. Only humans bend nature to their will, at least in this visible way. Once gone, we leave a heavy trail of concrete, steel, broken glass and wires everywhere. It looks ugly, but then, no one is there to care about beauty and ugliness. </p><p>Out of the screen and into the theatre a second experience unfolds. It doesn't happen that often that a group of us is asked to sit quietly for 94 minutes staring at nature. A few fall asleep. It's Saturday afternoon and we are all tired. My mind is left free to go around. I look at the details on the screen, think of thoughts I wrote above. Think of something else, then back to the screen. Where is this place? What happened to all the people? Time is up, light's on. We sit in silence for a while, aware of our presence like rarely before. We are the master of this world, and then again, after us no one will care. </p><p><iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2oOjYjNUrms?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p> </p><p><br></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>What I have been listening to</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>As a father of one, two, and now three, I find inevitably a bunch of house chores waiting for me every day when I get home. My infovore dna would rather have me reading or writing something and that's when I started to fall more and more into the podcast rabbit hole. </p><p>There is a lot of potential in the medium and I see more and more people waking up to that. There is also a lot of repetition, the typical podcast format is the interview (or dialogue) and the same people get interviewed a lot, especially in tech/VC circle[1]. Some producers are experiencing with new narrative forms (Serial the most famous of them) but I can see in my habits that information/learning still has a preference vs entertainment. </p><p>Discovery and recommendation play a different role for podcasting than blogging. First, there are fewer podcasts produced than posts written on a weekly basis. Podcast are also more resource intensive and the barrier to entry are still higher than "just" writing. A newsletter curating podcasts is less useful that one curating written content (a form of curation that has exploded in the last couple of years). People follow (subscribe) to specific hosts rather than picking and choosing one episode at a time. It is rare that the unknown host produces one memorable episode among many not-so-memorable ones. Consistency is much more in the hands of the host than it is in the hands of the blogger. And so on. </p><p>With this in mind, I decided to start noting down what I listen to every week. It might end up being useful for somebody to discover new content or just for me as a sort of journal stimulating some reflections on where podcasting is going. Let's see. </p><p>Ok, already now this is an issue. Since I listen mostly on my phone (like most people I guess) I don't have an easy way to find links to podcasts I have listened to on my computer. I am now browsing a podcasting app as activity record and wondering how to copy/paste those links into this post. Sounds pretty stupid but here we go, immediately an impediment for podcast curation on the written web. </p><p>Update. I figured that I could just move to editing this post on my phone, copying links from my podcasting app and pasting them into the editor in my mobile browser. Fail again. When I paste the link the url is, obviously, that of the specific app I am listening with. This means if my readers don't have that app they are stuck.</p><p>Update 2. Luckily, the people at breaker (the app I am using now) have an open web version where you can listen to the podcast without downloading the app, so the experience of clicking through their link is not that terrible. I'll stick to using their links, they are doing a very good job and you should give it a try.  </p><p>So, this week:</p><p>a16z: "From Hidden Figure to Sonic BOOM" <a href="https://breaker.audio/e/16959840">https://breaker.audio/e/16959840</a></p><p>Funny enough, I listened to this just a couple of days after watching "Hidden Figures", the movie, with my daughter. I didn't know about this story, it's a very good one. </p><p>99% Invisible: "251- Negative Space: Logo Design with Michael Bierut" <a href="https://breaker.audio/e/16512648">https://breaker.audio/e/16512648</a></p><p>I listen on and off to 99PI. Roman Mars' voice is the closest I get to guided meditation. This interview is exceptionally good.</p><p>The Ezra Klein Show: "David Chang, head of the Momofuku empire" <a href="https://breaker.audio/e/4005921">https://breaker.audio/e/4005921</a></p><p>This is another thing about podcasts. Once you discover a new show, you can spend a lot of time going back through old episodes. A good show is likely to have produced consistently good episodes and I like to binge on the once I found one. </p><p>The Ezra Klein Show: "Tyler Cowen explains it all" <a href="https://breaker.audio/e/17276142">https://breaker.audio/e/17276142</a></p><p>See above comment. This is one is even more, a cross reference between two shows I like a lot recently. First listen to Cowen interviewing Ezra Klein, then to the reverse. Podcasting is a small circle. There is a passage around 18:58 about weaknesses and strengths that I really loved. Writing more about that soon. </p><p>The Twenty Minute VC: Venture Capital "a16z's Balaji Srinivasan on Why There Is A Financial Incentive For Truth In VC &amp; Why The Best VCs Invest In Founder To Make Them Richer Than Themselves" <a href="https://breaker.audio/e/5044338">https://breaker.audio/e/5044338</a></p><p>I must admit I have been "snobbing" the 20m VC for a long time. Mostly because I try to get a break from VC/Tech/Startup stuff when I am back home, but also because of the style of the interviews. Just a matter of taste I guess. I have to concede that guests are great and they very often drop invaluable knowledge. Like in this case. In this episode, Balaji says something extremely interesting about pocket of values in outdated regulations. Regulatory arbitrage has been the source of (at least) 2 multi-billion dollar businesses in the past years (Uber and Airbnb), what else could be there? </p><p>How I Built This: "Power Rangers: Haim Saban" <a href="https://breaker.audio/e/17170719">https://breaker.audio/e/17170719</a></p><p>This story is just incredible. Haim Saban is the impersonification of hustling (in the positive sense Haim, don't worry). This quote says it all: "The biggest hits I have had in my life has been always as the result of significant and repeated rejection. So every time i have an idea where people tell me 'don't do that', I think 'ups, I am on to something'".  (please allow quoting sound bites!!)</p><p>--</p><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
<p></p>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p>[1] Incentives play a role here. Lots of new tech podcasts are coming up since techies are the main early adopters of podcasts. All new podcasts try to interview famous tech people (mostly VCs) and they, in turn, have a strong incentive to be interviewed (ego plays a big role too). We end up with multiple podcast hosts trying to boost their visibility by interviewing a smaller number of successful people. The result is a lot of repetition and also a good number of dull episodes where the status gap between host and guest is so high that the entire thing ends up being more an exercise in adulation instead of a true dialogue. <br></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>I have never bought a copy of The New Yorker. I have read a number of articles over the years, and mostly liked them, and I have often thought about subscribing, without ever finding the courage to do it. The other day I saw an old issue on the table of a café. For I moment I decided to grab it, put it in my bag and read it on the flight home. Then I thought of what my father would think. <br></p><p>My father runs a construction company. He has done that for his whole life after taking over from my grandfather who took over from his father in law. When my grandfather died my father was 32, he took over a company with more than 100 workers and a complicated financial situation. Back in those days, employing people was a pride and a responsibility[1]. Construction, like manufacturing, needs people of all kinds. The entrepreneur - in the Italian North-East trained on the shop floor more often than in school - a few engineers and architects, middle managers - if you are big enough, which is rare - and workers[2].<br></p><p>Visiting the construction sites is a daily ritual. Owner and workers know perfectly well about their different roles, and what that means. There is no illusion of equality and yet no tangible feeling of the opposite. As you arrive, the most visible symbol of status is left in the parking lot. Once in, differences fade. Your shoes carry the same mud, your hands are dirty with the same dust. You drink the same coffee - in the old days often mixed with red wine - and the fanciest place you can retreat to is a container turned office, where cigarette butts rest sadly in small plastic cups. <br></p><p>It is partly the job and party, I guess, the town. I come from a small provincial town in the north of the country where everybody goes to public school and we don't really have an intellectual class. There are lawyers and doctors and other people with a degree. In my family, it is me and my mum - an English teacher. My father started but never finished. Education is not measured in habits or social circles - that's more of a big city thing. It is rather a matter of taste: the books you read, the place you visits, what you know of history and art. <br></p><p>Contemporary art is where I often draw the line between education and intellectualism[3]. "Education" is the ability to appreciate the beautiful. Intellectualism requires a jump in sophistication, the one required to appreciate most contemporary art. You go to a museum or a gallery - by itself a deliberate act - and walk through art pieces whose meaning is rarely confined to what the eye can see. Classical art is more democratic and more popular, religious art in particular. It is exhibited or directly painted in churches that you can simply visit. Churches themselves are pieces of art meant to be seen and visited by everyone. Even today when most visitors are there more for the frescos than for the mass, churches attract the blue-collar tourists, the one arriving by bus with their home made sandwiches, the ones that don't really care about staying at an Airbnb so that they can experience local cafes at brunch time. <br></p><p>My love-and-shame relationship with The New Yorker is all here. It is the struggle between what I like and what I fear becoming. I have moved abroad, I live in a city, I have recently been to the cinema to watch a documentary about some Japanese female divers from a remote fishing village. What do I have left in common with the workers in my father's construction company?   <br></p><p>Where the gap between my father and them was more about wealth mine is more about taste. Food and restaurant tastes, wine choices, books, the nearly complete elimination of tv from my life. Maybe all of this is normal and that's just the way it works when you decide to leave your hometown and do something else with your life. <br></p><p>Maybe. I remember a story I used to listen to when I was a child. It was the story of this boy who is too good and then one day he wakes up with a pair of wings growing out of his back. He is becoming an angel. He then starts doing all kind of bad things, but he overcompensates and he becomes a devil instead, with tail and all. Finally, he manages to get back to normal. From that day he will again be a good boy, but when it is time to go to bed, just once in a while, he will skip brushing his teeth. That subscription can wait.  <br></p><p>--- </p><p>[1] Since we are in 2017, the company doesn't employ that many people anymore. A couple of full-time staff in then office and contractors for the actual work. Since we are in Italy, the company is always on the brink of death. Everything related to the old days is coloured by nostalgia. </p><p>[2]An under-explored topic in the transition from a manufacturing economy to a service and information one is the erosion of social diversity at the company level. In tech companies most people have similar status and education, there is little difference between them. When that exist, like in the case of uber drivers, it's pushed out of the company. </p><p>[3] Not meant in a derogatory way. </p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Last weekend I watched Empire of Dreams, the 2004 documentary on Star Wars (you can find it on youtube). I was never one of those huge fans of the series - of the two Harrison Fords I loved Indiana Jones [1] more than Han Solo. The documentary though is really great, the epic of Star Wars being even better than the Star Wars epic. </p><p>George Lucas is a Californian entrepreneur, and this is no coincidence. As I was watching pieces of the documentary with my daughter and discussing a future trip to Los Angeles, I couldn't avoid talking about dreams. Everybody has them. We have stories in Italy that are in no way less heroic and dramatic and grand as the story of Star Wars, Apple, Pixar and many other Californian dreams. But our stories follow typically a different trajectory: a young person starts working on the factory floor and goes through a series of hardships, he emerges as a smart fellow with ambitions bigger than working for others, over time he accumulates enough savings to break out and start his own firm, the firm develops from tiny workshop to global giant[2]. </p><p>George Lucas dreamt about making a space movie. He wanted the ability and independence to produce his own story but needed the money to do so. He gets a budget from Fox, gathers a group of unproven, and mostly unknown, actors and special effects makers, bets on innovation that doesn't exist yet. It is a story of vision, near-death failures, last minute sprints and fixes and ultimate overwhelming, unexpected success. A great Californian story. </p><p>--- </p><p>[1] Riders of the Lost Ark is still one of my favourite movies. Nothing can beat archaeology mixed with history mixed with religion mixed with magic. And that soundtrack... <br></p><p>[2] With few differences, this is the story of Ferrari and Luxottica, among others.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>There is a type of book or study that I often look for but seldom find. In my imagination it's called "a cultural history of.." and it's a kind of travel guide to the mentality of a place. <br></p><p>Countries, large regions and even cities, have a distinct mentality. It is more than "traditions" or "cultural events" and it goes beyond a collection of ethnicities, religions and sub-cultures. A place's mentality is a persistent yet invisible fabric that guides the people living there toward a certain type of recognisable macro-behaviour. It transcends individual beliefs and political views, and it applies to the newly settled just as much as to those who have been inhabiting a place for generations. </p><p>When I wrote about California as the "land of dreams" in my previous post, I meant the distinctive DNA that ties together Hollywood with Silicon Valley, going back to the Gold Rush and passing through surfing culture of the South and counterculture of the North. A mentality is the product of a place's history and the history of the people who lived there. However, a traditional history book will only give you the input to understand a mentality. These books are normally a sequence of events and don't spend too much time trying to understand how each event is related to the next (beyond a strict causality) and how they stratify and ossify to produce a place's mentality. <br></p><p>If you move to Rome today, you will see Roman ruins next to baroque fountains next to churches dating to the beginning of Christianity next to the balcony where Mussolini declared war next to a monument erected for a Piedmontese king which is also the tomb of the "unknown soldier" from the first world war. The innate sensibility of its people, their invincible cynicism, their allergy towards authority, and the sense of tragedy mixed with comedy that pervades every conversation, cannot be grasped without understanding this past. <br></p><p>I wish there were more books and travel guides that could help the foreign visitor and the occasional expat to a better understanding of this "mentality". You cannot understand a place without grasping how its people think, even when they don't know they think like this. <br></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>I look forward to a future where digital and physical mix and where we go back to have a mostly physical life, but digitally enhanced. </p><p>There are a lot of good reasons to worry about that, and I have listed some in a <a href="https://medium.com/the-founders-blog/when-reality-is-made-of-bits-e30225502e63http://" target="_blank">previous post</a>. Leaving this aside for a moment, there are also many reasons why we should be happy that our inescapable digital future that has so far sucked us into two-dimensional glassware will finally spit us back to the three-dimensional world where we belong. The future that awaits us is one where we freely utilise data generated by living in a world of bits to make choices in a world of atoms. </p><p>An interesting example comes, not surprisingly, from Amazon whose CEO is on record saying that there is nothing "new" about opening physical stores and that the focus of the company will always be delighting customers and if customers want - also - physical stores then this is what Amazon will do. </p><p>This recent tweet with photos taken from one of the first Amazon bookstores shows where the potential lies.</p><p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">These are some of the ways that the Amazon brick and mortar book store is categorizing books. <a href="https://t.co/fTwZCokK4O">pic.twitter.com/fTwZCokK4O</a></p>— Paul Shapiro (@fighto) <a href="https://twitter.com/fighto/status/848624399024611330">April 2, 2017</a>
</blockquote></p><p>Data tracked from our digital interaction with amazon and kindle is used to create innovative classifications and smart in-store signage. Just judging from these photos it seems already a better way than "history", "politics", "fiction" or simple alphabetical sorting. It is worth noticing that Amazon can do this because we have now been buying books on its website for a long time and that, since introducing kindle, it has been also able to track what we read, what we highlight, what we finish and what we don't (and where we stop in those cases). </p><p>Again, forget about how creepy this all sounds when we really think about that - this part will have to be solved, at least I hope [1] - and think about a future where the same level of tracking can be embedded in our physical world. The optimistic view is to see that as the time where digital loses its advantage against physical. I want to be optimistic. </p><p><br></p><p>[1] Every time I think about this I see no alternative to a system where we have private ownership of data combined with the ability to give third parties access to it. </p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>We see a lot of attempts these days to take us through a new technological leap. Voice computing and AR are two noticeable examples. In these moments, it is easy to follow a linear path: first, something doesn't exist, then you get a crappy version of it, then a better one and then it works. </p><p>From a pure technology point of view this makes sense, nothing is born in its perfect version. Things, however, gets more complicated from a user - or usage - point of view. We are sold dreams that don't exist, and that annoys us. A good example is a few attempts I have seen recently to capture meeting notes by listening to conversations. We are too far today from a sufficiently good version of this, and I am also asking myself whether this is something I would ever want. </p><p>But this is not the point. If we imagine the perfect experience as being one where: you meet with your colleagues, you start talking through the agenda, you agree on next steps, you stand up and leave the room and, magic, all notes are perfectly there - what is then the intermediate step? </p><p>To find the answer, we need to look at Netflix. In its early days they already had a clear idea that streaming would be the future, but where did they start? The didn't offer a crappy streaming product, the sent DVD's to people. Here is what Reed Hastings says about that: </p><p>"We always viewed the DVD by mail as a digital distribution network, and then we knew eventually... that's why we called the company Netflix and not 'DVD by mail'" </p><p>This is the perfect intermediate step. </p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Here is a new challenge. I normally write in the morning, before waking up the kids. I never have more than thirty, maybe forty, minutes. Sit down, look at some notes I have typed the day before, anything new on my mind after the night? The clock races. If I am not done by 6:50 we'll be late again. Writing more than 500 words is a painful process, I published something yesterday I wasn't happy about. I should be better at throwing out an entire draft and start from scratch when it just doesn't work. Writing short is different. Open the editor, even the phone is just good enough. The cursor is blinking, what time is it already? Today I wanted to write about visions and narratives. I had this conversation the other night and I realised something about how I tend to make decisions, it would make for a good short post. Not today though. As I am typing these words, my laptop tells me I running out of battery, the charger at work - thank you apple. I will push "save and publish" now, it's 6:42, I am on time, for once. </p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>I have opinions on most topics. At time quite strong, often - at least I hope - weekly held. Given that what I do consists in large part in thinking about product ideas, I also have a lot of opinions about what would work, and wouldn't, in a wide range of markets. </p><p>It's both a blessing and a sin. Every time I meet an entrepreneur working on a new product, I fall inevitably in the confirmation trap. Is she working on the angle I think would work? It's a terrible way of judging other people's ideas, and yet a very human one. I understand much better now the difference between a good investor and a rookie: the rookie will pretend - consciously or not - to know more than the entrepreneurs and seek teams that fit in his or her frame, the good one instead will remain objective, and open-minded, and let the entrepreneur show the way. Entrepreneurs are the ones creating the future. </p><p>There is a consequence to this. A good investor will inevitably tend to be sceptical and will try to underpin her judgment by looking for facts. The team's track record, usage metrics, growth, etc. Investors are patient and often prefer to wait precisely <u>because</u> they understand that their judgment - everyone's judgement - is easily biased. </p><p>But what to do when you can't wait? If you are a founder, or a co-founder, or an investor that wants to get in before any solid fact reaches the table, the only thing you have left is vision. Conscious of my bias, I will be happy taking a risk if it means following my vision. Right or wrong, it is at least mine. The only alternative is to buy into someone else's - and thus make it mine. </p><p>So this is my decision criteria in these situations: it's either my vision or yours, in all other cases I'd rather wait. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Every time I walk into a WeWork I can't help thinking about Marx. What do a modern, hipster, co-working space and Das Kapital have in common? After all, WeWork is a symbol of today's entrepreneurial renaissance: scruffy startups and hustling freelancers breaking the yoke of salaried labour to realise their dream. All true. But there is more under the surface. Behind the cosy vintage-looking furniture, the coloured coffee-table books and the free beer, I see an army of hard-working people struggling to make ends meet while happily handing over a large chunk of their income to a multi-billion dollar real estate company in exchange for what is basically a Dilbert-style cubicle. Don't get me wrong here: everybody is just doing their job, no scam, no forcing of anybody to take up the deal. It reminds me, tough, of the discussion around positive externalities and consumer surplus which we are receiving from our ads-driven internet giant. True, we get a lot of stuff for free, but at what real cost? Let's call a spade a spade, free beer and cosy furniture have a price. A certain German philosopher would have a name for that: false consciousness.  </p><p><br></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>I came across an <a href="https://medium.com/@gerstenzang/the-right-way-to-start-a-company-8fe4932b59d0http://" target="_blank">old post from Sam Gerstenzang</a> which summarises pretty well what I have learnt in four years of starting companies through Founders. </p><blockquote><p><i>"Silicon Valley loves the mission-based startup and retroactively constructs a founder mythology. But big companies get started because someone takes the leap, she listens to </i><i>encouragement,</i><i> and ignores the haters until the company reaches product-market fit. That part is always the same."</i></p></blockquote><p><i></i></p><p>It reminded me of a chapter in "Thinking, fast and slow", dedicated to entrepreneurs' innate, and illogical, optimism. It also reminded me of Indiana Jones and the last Crusade, when Indi is facing the second trial and has to take the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-JIfjNnnMA" target="_blank">"leap of faith"</a> to reach the Graal. Imagine if he had simply fallen down, ending his quest, and the movie, in the most unglamorous way. Celebrating faith is easy when it turned out to be the right choice, yet any rational person should not have attempted that in the first place. </p><p>There are a couple of ways to overcome rationality and take the leap. The first one is to be blind to the challenge, either because we believe so much in ourselves or because we are naive and wholly unprepared. The other one is to trick our mind and push any true probability assessment to a later moment. This is Paul Graham's "questions", and it still the best trick I know to get started. </p><p>Each startup is a journey against sound thinking and probability. It begins with the irrational decision to attempt something that is doomed to fail and it continues through the delusion of persevering when any sane person would quit and do something better with their life. Until one day you make it, and it all becomes obvious.</p><p><i><br></i></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>This weekend we held Founders annual offsite. When planning for it, different people made me realise that we had probably underplanned it. "Sounds great", they said as they were telling me about offsites that turn out to be a little more than a long long meeting in a location far from the office. But I started to have my doubts. </p><p>In our busy business life there is a clear bias for efficiency. We want everything to run smoothly, we want to be doers and we want to use every single minute in the most optimised way. Going the opposite direction feels sloppy and it is difficult to kick away that guilty feeling. Then, as the first day unfolds,  you start to see the magic happening. People that would normally barely have time for a quick "good morning" getting together and engaging in deep conversations, lots of side discussions getting to the bottom of past situations not properly closed, plans being made, ambitions being shared. </p><p>I think now that feeling comfortable with unplanned time takes courage and experience. Falling back to filling every moment with an agenda item is the easy thing. Controlling for efficiency can guarantee a safe outcome, but it will never be like optimising for serendipity. It's like engaging in a long dialogue and feeling comfortable with keeping silent. Try it. </p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The rudder effect </title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Sailing metaphors are a much used - and abused - way to describe the act of running a team or a company. A leader is "firmly at the wheel" and "motivates the crew" to "stay on course" while facing "rough waters". It all reminds me of a set of posters I once saw in some office: large pictures of a sailing boat, people working together on at the winches, waves crashing on the sides, a skipper seriously - but calmly - looking at the horizon, a large "TEAMWORK" printed in large letters just below the image. If you find it cheesy, count me in with you. </p><p>There is one thing though that running a team has truly in common with sailing, and that's the concept of correcting. Rubber is controlled directly, you touch the wheel and your car, bike, truck, turns. A rudder, instead, acts by (re)directing the energy created by the propeller or, in the case of a sailing boat, by the wind. The main implication of this difference is a lag between stimulus (your movement on the wheel) and action (the boat actually changing course). Partially because of that, and partially due to a lower sensibility, the change imposed by the rudder ends up having bigger impact than we originally intended. The result is "correcting", a steering style that consists of seamingly contradicting inputs to maintain a steady course.</p><p>I find the same applying to the motion of a team. It is natural for a team, at any point of time, to be erring on one particular side. Too much attention to details or too little, too much self criticism or too little, too much dialogue or too little. Nobody has yet invented a mixer for human interaction: you get tempered water by adding first cold then warm, and viceversa. A good team can recognize the erring and correct  it by opening the other faucet. </p><p>Back to sailing. A poor skipper will apply too much force in each direction, causing confusion to the boat and losing wind. A good one will use her sensibility to delicately adjust course.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Among the many pearls we received from the mountains of Davos, this list of things successful people do in the morning is probably the best one.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">14 things successful people do before breakfast <a href="https://t.co/6rlLI26DB4">https://t.co/6rlLI26DB4</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/work?src=hash">#work</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/leadership?src=hash">#leadership</a> <a href="https://t.co/6jW0WkML3P">pic.twitter.com/6jW0WkML3P</a></p>— World Economic Forum (@wef) <a href="https://twitter.com/wef/status/661196169549336576">November 2, 2015</a>
</blockquote></p>

<p>Leaving the <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesrbuk/status/661195314989285377">ridiculous aside</a>, the list points to a growing phenomenon: being it meditation, the five-minute workout, or writing (like in my case), daily rituals are becoming synonymous with living an efficient and successful life.</p>

<p>Since beginning blogging regularly I have struggled with balancing between the painful pleasure of embarking in long posts and the satisfaction in the discipline of daily writing. A couple of months ago I have started my own small ritual: I wake up at 6 am, prepare coffee and start writing. By 6:45, when it is time to wake up the kids, I have to hit "publish". Considering travel, weekends (where I try to focus on longer posts) and the occasional oversleeping, I have done quite well, 32 posts in 60 days.</p>

<p>The original idea was to compartmentalise my writing, short in the morning and long, well, some other time. What seemed to have happened instead is an increase in complacency and a decrease in writing quality. Beyond the natural constraints of time-boxing, imposing a daily habit has given room to a certain complacency that is impacting negatively my ability to embark on longer, more ambitious projects. Is my writing habit - along with all other habits - just another form of <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/style/2013/02/01/the-growing-culture-impatience-where-instant-gratification-makes-crave-more-instant-gratification/q8tWDNGeJB2mm45fQxtTQP/story.html">instant gratification</a>?</p>

<h2>Treacherous pleasure</h2>

<p>Daily rituals appeal to our desire to be disciplined and consistent. They also allow us to turn ambitious long-term goals, like getting into better physical shape, into manageable bites. Getting something done every day is a real booster for self-confidence, but the main question remains whether they actually work.</p>

<p>When I started my (semi-)daily writing habit I did it for two reasons. I wanted a place to capture my thoughts and, in turn, develop a better noticing muscle. Twitter is quite good at that but its mechanics make it little rewarding if you don't have a lot of followers. The alternative would be to work through that first, but that's a bigger goal and it will eliminate the purpose of a manageable daily activity. Writing in short form - around 500 words per post - offered me a sweet spot. It is something I can manage do achieve almost every day (discipline) and gives me a strong sense of accomplishment, way more than a tweet. It felt good, for the first few weeks.</p>

<p>Athletes know though that muscles become lazy when you keep repeating the same workout. It is an inevitable drawback of being an amazing learning machine. Every time an exercise is repeated, our body learns how to go through it in a more efficient way. The intensity of the effort diminishes and while the mental benefits persist (you keep patting yourself on then back just for showing up). Progress reaches a plateau.</p>

<p>Writing differs from exercising in that the aim is to create something finite and not "simply" keep the brain active. Sticking to a daily routine is even more treacherous, there is a wide gap between our long-term goals - which might be to use writing for insight generation or more mundanely to create an audience - and the short-term pleasure of hitting "publish" every day. No sequence of short posts can deliver the sort of "insight porn" both readers and writers can attain when pushing the limits of quantity in a non-mechanical way (listicles not allowed).</p>

<p>Ultimately, it is a matter of patience and deferred pleasure. The more we train our brain to its daily shot of accomplishment-induce endorphin, the more we become addicted to it. Daily habits are popular because they deliver on their promise: they make life look simple and us look good, a seven minutes workout is all we need to be in shape. Deeper down, they give us the illusion that we can avoid schlep.</p>

<h2>Schlepping through time</h2>

<p>All important endeavours have something in common: they involve a lot of schlep. The issue is that most of us (all probably) have an innate tendency to avoid it, to live in the hope that something beautiful can come out by sole act of conceptualising it.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>"No one likes schleps, but hackers especially dislike them. Most hackers who start startups wish they could do it by just writing some clever software, putting it on a server somewhere, and watching the money roll in—without ever having to talk to users, or negotiate with other companies, or deal with other people's broken code. Maybe that's possible, but I haven't seen it."  Paul Graham</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The sad reality is one where no shortcuts exist. You cannot think of a decent long from post by planning it, just in the same way no truly successful startup can be "designed" at the drawing board before actually starting. It is this inevitable uncertainty that blocks us from embarking on long projects. The inability to clearly see the end and defer gratification. It doesn't matter that we have memory of accomplishing something before (although it helps), the fear of wasting time is too strong.</p>

<p>The same is true, in particular, for a lot of complex skills where the learning curve is flat, long and painful. My personal weakness is thinking that I can learn myself out of rookie status, that reading up will make me a better writer, developer (that I have barely started), etc. It is probably an inherited theory-fetish I got from school. "Deliberate practice", the only way to get there, is a much harder and schleppy activity. It's the tedious repetition of sub-skills until you have mastered them and then move to a new one.</p>

<p>How do we then accept "<a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2013/07/10/you-are-not-an-artisan/">schleppy work</a>"? How do we "defer gratification and accept, even seek out, a degree of pain based on the no-pain-no-gain heuristic."</p>

<h2>A random walk in Melee Island</h2>

<p>In my case, the answer came from a surprising place: the (almost) forgotten world of adventure games. Adventure games were a big thing in the late 80's and in the 90's but they slowly lost appeal among gratification-starving gamers. Why did it happen?</p>

<p>One school of thought tends to blame the invincible trend of shortening attention spans. Why should we spend hours wandering through an imagined world with basically no direction, poking around, asking questions and trying to solve puzzles just to get ahead in the game? You can find scores of adventure games fans <a href="https://games.slashdot.org/story/13/04/08/1155226/why-are-we-still-talking-about-lucasarts-old-adventure-games">ranting about this online</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>"Today all the games act like you have the attention span of a hamster and if shit isn't shooting and you or exploding for longer than 20 seconds you'll fall asleep".</i></p></blockquote>

<p>A better explanation blames adventure games themselves (or better designers of adventure games). <a href="http://www.oldmanmurray.com/features/77.html">Many of them simply took the exercise too far</a>, making a fetish out of the complexity of solving puzzles, forgetting that the actual value for the player is in going through a journey, following the plot to the end.</p>

<p>Great adventure games are open-ended and challenging without being frustrating. In its 1989 manifesto, Ron Gilbert (the mind behind Monkey Island and many other memorable adventure games) listed the <a href="http://grumpygamer.com/why_adventure_games_suck">principles to make adventures games that don't suck</a>. In the opening paragraph he defines the type of games he set out to make:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>"I enjoy games in which the pace is slow and the reward is for thinking and figuring, rather than quick reflexes."</i></p></blockquote>

<p>A key aspect of that is keeping the user in a state of suspension of disbelief:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>"As designers, our job is to keep people in this state for as long as possible. Every time the player has to restore a saved </i><i>game,</i><i> or pound his head on the desk in frustration, the suspension of disbelief is gone. At this time he is most likely to shut off the computer and go watch TV, at which point we all have lost."</i></p></blockquote>

<p>When you wander through the street of Melee Island, you have an overall awareness of your goals but the rest you discover by poking around, talking to the different characters, picking up stuff. It is fun to watch someone trying playing the game today (I recently introduced it to my 11 years old daughter), the first reaction is to ask "what am I supposed to do?".</p>

<p>Initially, it will be difficult to measure your progress. You visit the SCUMM bar and notice that the cook often comes out from the kitchen and walks into the main room (leaving the door open behind him), the prisoner at the local jail has a terrible breath and a weird looking individual is trying to sell you obviously fake maps. As you play along, some people will help you (let's call it, the muse). You will learn that you need to distract the dogs guarding the governor house, and you will remember about the piece of meat you have seen in the kitchen. You'll be told that one of your trial consists of digging up the famous treasure of Melee Island(TM) and you'll realise that map wasn't so bad after all. The shopkeeper will offer you some mints, and when you give that to the prisoner you'll make a useful friend for later stages in the game.</p>

<p>In a well-made adventure game, progress is the sum of small, apparently meaningless, discoveries. In Steve Jobs' style, connecting the dots can only happen in hindsight. The key is embracing curiosity, let go of short-term rewards and start exploring. Do it every day, that's the antidote for our daily habit mania.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>"You're going to get stuck. You're going to be frustrated. Some puzzles will be hard, but all the puzzles will be fair."</i></p></blockquote>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>In one of those serendipitous encounters that make life more enjoyable, I recently found myself reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_of_Christianity" title="Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_of_Christianity">"The Rise of Christianity"</a> by Rodney Stark</p>

<p>As an Italian, I studied my good deal of Roman and Christian history at school but I had never grasped how incredible, and totally non-obvious, an achievement was for this "obscure Jesus cult" to take over one of the vastest empires in history in merely 300 years. The question sets the scene for an exciting read, but on top of that, the author does an incredible job in keeping it condensed within 200 pages of clear sociological explanations without tedious enumeration of facts. I recommend the book to everybody interested not only in this specific chapter of human history but in the broader topic of how disruptive social and cultural change happens.</p>

<p>At the core of the book lies a simple yet ofter overlooked fact: any movement or phenomenon that can keep growing at a steady rate for a sufficiently long period of time will become dominant. Compound growth, as noted by Einstein (apocryphally) is the most powerful force in the universe. That's the obvious part. The non-obvious one is how to maintain said growth rate.</p>

<p>In Christianity's case, it was essentially a matter of "fit". Multiple aspects of the emerging faith made it the perfect killer of the incumbent Greek-Roman tradition. From the focus on family and procreation (amidst a largely unmarried and low natality population) to the commitment to charitable endeavours (which made the Christian population more resistant to epidemics), to their openness and ability of assimilation.</p>

<p>History takes often unique turns and we have no guarantee that the outcome would be the same if we could replay it from the start. The history of Christianity shows, however, that certain innovations are simply too powerful to be stopped. It seems like nothing is changing, until it changes forever.</p>        <div class="posthaven-gallery" id="posthaven_gallery[1167691]">

<em>“The gods had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, whence the stone would fall back of its own weight. They had thought with some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor.”</em> — Albert Camus, Sisyphus</blockquote>
<p>A few weeks ago I was sitting in a meeting room together with the cofounders of a company we had been working on for almost two years. Despite some promising signs and a lot of effort, the product had failed to show any visibile traction. We had agreed a month earlier to look for alternative directions and there we were, sitting together in the moment of reckoning. The painful conclusion loomed heavy in the room: it was time to throw in the towel.</p>
<p>This is not one of those “why we failed posts”. I am not a big fan of them, but that’s another story[1]. No, what that episode got me thinking about is how hard it is for us to see meaning in our failed attempts. How consuming the act of trying is.</p>
<p>At Founders, we have always stressed the advantage of being able to separate what you are working on from who you are: that <a href="https://hajak.se/how-to-be-a-failed-founder-with-a-successful-startup-9dced74d4b6c" target="_blank" title="Link: https://hajak.se/how-to-be-a-failed-founder-with-a-successful-startup-9dced74d4b6c">companies can fail but people shouldn’t</a>. Four years in, this remains an assumption. In real life, we have noticed that once a company goes down it’s just too difficult to immediately jump back on the saddle.</p>
<p>I was talking to one of the co-founders and suggesting a bunch of other things he could try. From my privileged point of observation, I couldn’t understand what was so difficult in seeing as a “normal” job the process of trial and error until finding something that works. Listening to his replies, I realised that what is daunting is not failing, it is spending a life searching.</p>
<h2>The real issue with product market fit</h2>
<p>Product market fit is a fickle concept. It can be lost, it keeps moving, and contrary to popular belief, things don’t get magically easier once you get there. Yet, even discounting for its vague definition, it is fair to talk about life before and after product market fit.</p>
<p>Founders who have been through it describe it as an “emotional grind”, telling stories of stress, loss of sleep, loss of weight (and, even worse signs of mental and physical distress). It is more than just the hard work. Hard work itself becomes a relative concept depending on where the company is. Burnout is not a function of time, but one of movement. Forcing something that doesn’t work <a href="https://twitter.com/bradfordcross/status/869369688882413568" target="_blank">drives burnout</a>, while the excitement for having (finally) found something that people want pushes everybody to give more.</p>
<p>We have been in this situation multiple times, and watched others doing the same. There is something exhausting about the uncertainty, the lack of positive feedback, the feeling that you are not progressing but endlessly circling back. It is a state of mind worse than the fear of failure, to the point that throwing the towel starts to be seen as a liberation. Not the dreaded moment where the world crumbles on you, but a break from the pain of futility and hopelessness.</p>
<p>The feeling of uncertainty, not the fear of failure, is also what blocks most people from getting started. It shows up as the perceived need to find a good idea, to validate the problem, to eliminate risk — all before jumping in. The big fear is finding out that we are toiling in vain, spending days, weeks, months on something no one wants. It is a vicious cycle: we don’t want to start before we know what will work, but without starting there is little chance to discover what that is.</p>
<p>Successful startups are built by two types of people: those who know how to manage the search and those who are naive enough not to care about it. We can keep relying on the latter, but we would be doing a good job if we could create more of the former. More specifically, we have to build a case for trying.</p>
<h2>An economic case for trying</h2>
<p>At the individual level, a lucid argumentation for trying comes from Paul Graham. In <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ladder.html" target="_blank">“After the Ladder”</a>, he makes an important observation about the (micro)economics of a predictable career:</p>
<p><em>Economic statistics are misleading because they ignore the value of safe jobs. An easy job from which one can’t be fired is worth money…</em></p>
<p>The near-certainty of a long, uninterrupted career, followed by a generous pension is comparable, in NPV terms, with scoring a big financial win early on in our life. The social pact between employers and employees around the ladder made it rational to forgo the allure of a potential big win for the stability of a steady job. Conversely, if this promise disappears it would be far more rational to attempt reaching long term financial safety by making the most of our wealth early in our life[2].</p>
<p>We are accustomed to see our working life as a linear progression. We start humbly but expect to see our position and wealth grow over time. This approach has multiple implications. Betting our lives on careers means jumping on whatever is most in demand at that point of time. Our only reference to project a career path is to look at others who have been through it. By definition, it means betting on careers that are already 20–30 years old. In addition, our expectation for increased wealth pushes us for upgrades as we climb the ladder. In doing so we commit ourselves to a certain life, entangled in debt and irreversible choices.</p>
<p>Embracing a life of searching can seem irresponsible. Even Paul Graham limits his comparison to the extreme cases: the safe job and the early win. There are lives in between. Careers assumed to be safe are ended abruptly leaving people in shock, unable to stand up again. Others keep searching for that win, but never find it. What choice is better? Trying provides the optionality that careers remove. It allows us the early slack to focus on what’s coming instead of what has been. It keeps options open and burn rate low. As the two tracks progress, the economic value of a career is locked down, the range of outcomes ever narrower. Continuous searching, even the unfruitful kind, leaves that door open for serendipity.</p>
<p>Despite the obvious risks, trying can be a rational economic choice for the individual. Its value, however, becomes even more apparent when we turn our attention to the aggregate, the macro.</p>
<p>We all understand intuitively that an economy of outliers favours a portfolio approach. Over many bets, one will yield disproportionate returns, covering for all the rest and more. We use metaphors like racing and natural selection, pointing to the fact that many attempts are required to produce a winner. But we often fail to appreciate the real meaning of “required”.</p>
<p>Natural selection, in particular, is often misunderstood. When talking about “survival of the fittest” we get the idea that the fittest can exist in isolation, that all other players are background actors in a movie that doesn’t need them. The need for a portfolio is driven by our inability to see through the noise and identify the fittest. We wouldn’t need a portfolio if we could predict the future. That’s an illusion. When we focus all our attention on the outcome of evolution we overlook the process at the core of it. Biological life is a learning machine. Each attempt contributes to the whole, revealing closed paths and indicating open ones for others to pursue.</p>
<p>Learning from biology, we can understand economies as evolutionary systems driven by a process of selection, variation and replication:</p>
<blockquote>“Evolution creates designs, or more appropriately, discovers designs through a process of trial and error. A variety of candiate designs are created and tried out in the environment. Designs that are successful are retained, replicated, and built upon, while those that are unsuccessful are discarded.”</blockquote> <blockquote>”From the perspective of an entrepreneur or a new entrant starting in the low valley of a new architecture, there are lots of ways up and many new, untried peaks to explore. Most attempts up from the entrepreneurial valley will wind up in dead-end canyons or on disappointing short peaks. But with enough explorers working away, someone will eventually find an attractive route up.</blockquote> <blockquote>Eric Beinhocker, The Origin of Wealth</blockquote>
<p>This collective climb is not a race between unrelated individuals. It reminds me more of this scene from World War Z where zombies step on top of each other to climb the wall.</p>

<p>The question now is: what’s in it for the zombies at the bottom of the pyramid?</p>
<h2>A modern Sisyphus</h2>
<p>That’s where Sisyphus come in. There is a meme going around the web comparing a day in the life of corporate to that of a startup. We can skip the corporate guy in his hamster wheel and focus on the startup guy. He is depicted pushing a boulder up the hill, a clear reference to the myth of Sisyphus, condemned by the gods to carry a stone up a mountain just to see it rolling down again soon after.</p>
<p>I have seen these meme many times, recently in <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelJordaan/status/871362560116895744" target="_blank">this tweet</a>.</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">One gets you somewhere eventually <a href="https://t.co/U3RrfFdL66">pic.twitter.com/U3RrfFdL66</a></p>— Michael Jordaan (@MichaelJordaan) <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelJordaan/status/871362560116895744">June 4, 2017</a>
</blockquote></p>
<div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>The issue with trying lies in the comment: “One gets you somewhere”. The truth is that most of the time it doesn’t. We miss the second half of the image, the downslope. Pretending to find relief from our Sisyphean toil in the hope of a result is perpetuating the same illusion at the root of our discomfort. What makes the search so miserable is precisely the expectation of progress, and the consequent feeling of despair when we realise that our work is without hope.</p>
<p>The solution lies instead in accepting our fundamental condition. For the French philosopher and existentialist Camus, Sisyphus is the ultimate hero. He has mastered the absurdity of a life without purpose and can now face his destiny with joy. As he walks back down the hill to pick up the boulder once again, Sisyphus is perfectly conscious of his fate. He resists despair not because he has hope, “to get somewhere”, but because he knows has not got anywhere.</p>
<blockquote>“Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”</blockquote>
<p>You must try.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Most arguments and disagreements stem from using the same word for multiple things. One of these words is "contradiction". </p><p>A person might contradict herself if she says something about a topic which doesn't apply to another one. For example, I can be a staunch defender of freedom of speech when it comes to my political faction, but I might take a more punitive position when the "freedom" to be defended belongs to my antagonist. </p><p>Another form of contradiction is the one that happens over time: I say something today that contradicts with something I used to say, or believe, in the past. There is a <a href="http://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr_KxouI8Zs" target="_blank">famous video</a> out there showing the (many) instances when Steve Jobs contradicted himself. Or rather, his previous self. </p><p>The first type of contradiction is bad. At best it is a glitch. Normally, it is pure hypocrisy. The second one is not only excusable, it is recommended. I hope to be able to learn something as I move along in my life and there is no better way of showing that than contradicting with your previous self. </p><p>I will start using two different expressions going forward: parallel contradiction (bad) and sequential contradiction (good). </p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>I was recently asked, after coming back from a vacation, if I consider "home" to be in Italy or in Copenhagen. <br></p><p>It is a simple question, but not an easy one to answer for many people in 2017. I have been in Denmark for 9 years, Copenhagen is the city where I live, work, where my kids go to school (2 out of 3 were born here) and where most of my things are. Yet, after all this time, every time I go to Italy I find myself invariably saying that I am going "home". Even when, like in my last visit, the place I am going to is more than 1000 km from the place where I was born and spent most of childhood. Reflecting more about it, I don't recall having used "home" to talk about Denmark even though I am pretty sure to have used the word "casa" which is the Italian equivalent but without the strict separation offered by the English language between the physical place and the emotional one. </p><p>What is "home" then? </p><p>As it happens often these days, it seems a case of a word describing a bundle of concepts which used to be together but are currently being unbundled. We have "home" the cultural place we belong to (Italy in my case), home the place where we live, home the place we grew up, etc. For most people, and most of the time, all these places used to be located in the same place. Today this is less and less the case. </p><p>It will be interesting to see if our language will evolve to describe this new reality or if we will simply go on using one word for many things and many places. I thrive in ambiguity, so count me in on that.</p><div><br></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Sceptical boldness</title>
      <link>http://stefanozorzi.xyz/sceptical-boldness</link>

      <author>Stefano Zorzi</author>
      <dc:creator>Stefano Zorzi</dc:creator>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p><i>(Toughts in progress - I plan to turn this into a longer post at a later point)</i><br></p><p>A couple of days ago I was biking home listening to a podcast. As the guest was going through his vision of the future I couldn’t stop being aware that I wasn’t able to believe. It was not that I didn’t agree with him - after all, it is all pure speculation - just that I simply couldn’t see that vision materialising. </p>
<p>With this thought stuck in my head, I began thinking of many other similar situations. I <a href="https://twitter.com/StefanoZorzi/status/895753157720121345" target="_blank">generalised on </a><a href="https://twitter.com/StefanoZorzi/status/895753157720121345" target="_blank">twitter</a><a href="https://twitter.com/StefanoZorzi/status/895753157720121345" target="_blank">,</a> and went on with my things. </p>
<p>As I woke up, a small debate had started around my tweet. My friend Stefano commented that “not being able to believe” makes it hard to be an investor. Malcolm Ocean chipped in with a different view. I agree with him. I don’t consider believing a necessary condition for action. </p>
<p>My point of departure is that of a sceptic. Maybe not always, maybe not in all fields, but I definitely find myself often in situations where I am the sceptic in the room. And yet it would be difficult to argue that I am risk averse, hesitant, indecisive, or that I don’t follow dreams, that I don’t get excited about wild projects.</p>
<p>So, apparently, I am able to reconcile non-believing and acting. But if not a belief, something else must be there to motivate my actions, to give me energy. Actually, I am quite prone to get excited, and if I think about it, I could even be accused of being gullible, at least at first impression. In fact, I am actually a sucker for narratives. </p>
<p>What makes a narrative different than a belief? A narrative is a logical/plausible argumentation of a hypothetical future <sup>1</sup>. You can <i>believe</i> in a narrative but I distinguish a narrative from a belief by the fact that a belief is more intuitive - instinctive even - while a narrative requires at least the appearance of a logical argumentation. </p>
<p>I say “the appearance” because I am not claiming here that a narrative is necessarily superior from a “truthiness” point of view to a belief. Both can be right and both can be wrong. But a narrative has a superior argumentative content. A narrative will include a concatenation of assumptions which, individually, can be analysed as sub-narratives, until we find simple statements that can be evaluated and, eventually, confirmed or disproven. A belief has inferior argumentative power than a narrative and rests on statements like “that’s inevitable” or “is in the nature of things” and similar. </p>
<p>There are then situations where forming a narrative is not possible, but we can find nonetheless a reason to act. I can see two of these. The first one is hedging. Hedging happens where situations of low probability - true or perceived - can generate high costs or large missed gains. In these cases, the main motivation is regret minimization or loss avoidance. Hedging, though, is very passive in nature and doesn’t generate sufficient energy for prolonged action. There is simply not enough conviction in a hedging argument to motivate anything more than a one-off effort, for example placing a monetary bet or buying an insurance. Nobody builds a company as part of a hedging strategy<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>A second non-narrative, non-belief form of action is generated by “what-if” statements. This is essentially a matter of curiosity. What-ifs are what side projects are typically based on. Side projects lack belief and/or narrative (depending on which type of person you are) to become full-time projects but have stronger energy than mere hedging activities. Sometimes, side projects generate sufficient conviction - for example by confirming an assumption that can then become the backbone of a new narrative - to become full-time projects. In the interim, the previous full-time project - like a full-time job - moves from being the main narrative to being a pure hedging strategy. When this happens, there is simply too little energy to continue properly. These are the cases where people go to work and end up working on their side project all the time, until either they get caught - and likely fired - or they quit. Eventually, even the hedging is dropped or substituted for another less action-intensive hedging. </p>
<p>The investing side of what-if actions is optionality. Investors will at times make bets where there is no belief and no narrative if the upside of something realising its hypothetical potential is high enough to justify the bet and the effort - and risk taking - that goes into it. In the investor case, the difference between optionality and hedging is not that pronounced, but it is still a different thing. Optionality is about keeping a door open for future action. It is a bit like procrastinating until stronger conviction kicks in - like in the case of side projects - while hedging is mostly a one-off event to then move on. </p>
<p>It is often said that the ability to suspend disbelief is a key trait of entrepreneurs and investors, especially the most visionary ones. Suspending disbelief doesn’t necessarily mean believing. For non-believers, it all boils down to our degree of scepticism. St. Thomas had to touch before he could actually believe - he was an absolute sceptic, he could not suspend disbelief. Pascal found a logical trick to justify believing without believing - he was hedging. The scientific method allows us to proceed by series of guesses, as long as we are willing to test their validity by attempting to falsify them. The suspension of disbelief does not require the suspension of reason. A sceptic can also be brave.</p>
<p>––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––</p>
<p><sup>1	</sup>It can also be an explanation/rationalisation of present or past events, but this is not so relevant for this discussion.<br><sup></sup></p>
<p><sup>	2	</sup>This is why most “cover your ass” corporate innovation/disruption initiatives fail - you basically hope them not to happen.<br></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>I often catch myself using the verb "consider" when putting down a note on something I am working on or when given feedback on someone else's work. What I mean - following Cambridge Dictionary - is: "spend time thinking about a possibility". </p><p>This may seem an innocent advice, even a good one. What's wrong with pondering an action, mulling over a potential alternative or simply spending time <i>considering </i>the value of a certain proposal? </p><p>To answer this question, compare these two sentences from a note I added while reviewing a presentation I was working on:<br></p><p>a) "Consider moving this slide earlier in the presentation."</p><p>b) "Try moving this slide earlier in the presentation."</p><p>Sentence a) achieves nothing. It notes that something could be done different but leaves the decision for later. Something didn't feel right, we now know about it, and the thought of it is hanging there in the back of our mind bothering our subconscious without moving anything forward. It's like <i>s﻿nooze, </i>﻿but for our brain. </p><p>There are many situations where it is good to postpone a final decision, but even in that case, what will this help me do? If I move on to other things and then get back to this presentation will I have made a better decision? Leaving out something hanging like this adds little value and comports a cognitive load. </p><p>Sentence b) is much better. It maintains all the benefits of an open and delayed decision but eliminates all the negatives. It carries within itself the solution to our doubts. By trying out the change, we can experience how it would feel and we will then be in a much better position to decide what to do. <br></p><p>There are two interesting aspects to this:</p><p>1. The first relates to a shift from scarcity to abundance. The idea of thinking before doing - intended as in this example, not as a prevention of impulsive acts - is part of the legacy of an age of scarcity where actions are very material and often irreversible. On the other hand, in a situation of abundance - like writing (words or code), and digital production in general - the risk, and cost of experimentation is much lower. It is, therefore, preferable to act and test rather than assume we can find the answer to a question through endless debates in a meeting room or by just letting it sink in our head. </p><p>2. The second one is about giving good feedback. If we use "consider", we leave all the weigh of the decision to the other person. Acting from a position of superiority, we instill doubt and then move on. But we don't get our hands dirty, we don't take any risk or expose ourselves to failure - not even the failure of our advice. Good feedback should be direct: "move this slide to the top". Sometimes this is not possible; we just don't know what's best or we don't want to "impose" a decision. In these cases, framing the advice in terms of trying is the best choice. It suggests an action while leaving the door open for evaluation: "try moving the slide, then see how it feels and decide by yourself". </p><p>This achieves the right balance between actionable feedback and leaving the person in charge - as it shold be.</p><p> <br></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>I am becoming increasingly convinced that confidence is a poor judge of quality. At least for me. <br></p><p>A few days ago I had to write a short statement for a group discussion. After a couple of hours of work I had written about 400 words, and felt quite proud of myself. I rehearsed the statement a couple of times in my head and closed my laptop. Job done. <br></p><p>The same night, I had the chance to try out some of the arguments with a person sitting next to me at dinner. I barely made it though the main point that she had already spotted a big flaw. I ended up throwing away the entire thing. <br></p><p>The opposite happens as well, with similar frequency. There are times where I have an idea, an hypothesis, or maybe the beginning of a theory and I feel pretty bad about it. It seems unoriginal, weak and poorly formed. In these situations, I tend to shelf my drafts or keep my thoughts to me, but the times when I end up sharing them - reluctantly - I am often surprised about the outcome. <br></p><p>Why does this happen? It can be that I am simply a very bad judge or my own ideas. But there is probably more to it. It has to do with pushing our boundaries and doing something uncomfortable. <br></p><p> When we are easily satisfied about something we have done, it is likely because we have uncovered something obvious. It doesn’t matter how original it may seem. Our subconscious recognises a pattern and clicks. </p><p>On the other hand, being unhappy about what we have created doesn’t mean it is all necessarily bad. A possible explanation is that we simply can’t see what we have done. We are far from having a complete picture, and that’s what causes the unhappiness, but we might have uncovered something worth of someone else’s attention. When we share these imperfect yet potentially interesting ideas, other people are able to see through the imperfection and spot the interestingness. <br></p><p>Overconfidence pollutes all residual points of interest. Insecurity allows the receiver to see through our unfinished work and surface its potential.  <br></p><p>Here is a short "note to self": <br></p><p>When very confident about an idea or theory, doubt yourself. Test it with someone as soon as possible and be prepared for re-writing. <br></p><p>When unhappy about an idea or theory, don’t throw it away immediately. Let it linger a bit, share it with a few persons you trust and whose feedback you respect. If it is indeed bad, they will tell you. But you might also discover that under you insecurity there is a diamond in the making. <br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How I think about creating things</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>Somebody asked me a great question recently: “What’s the single most important thing you have read or learned that profoundly shaped how you think and work?”</p>

<p>On the spot, I hesitated. There is probably no “single thing”, but a combination of influences, experiences and lessons resulting in the way I see the world today.</p>

<p>At a closer look, though, it is more like many small streams flowing into the same larger river. There is one big thread connecting these different sources. It has to do with the realisation that creative acts require the ability to fully abandon oneself to the process.</p>

<h2>Action and attachment</h2>

<p>Since my Indian studies at university, I have been attracted to the principle of “detachment from the fruits of action”. It is one of the main teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, which I first discovered through Gandhi’s interpretation:</p>

<p><em>“This is the unmistakable teaching of the Gita. He who gives up action falls. He who gives up only the reward rises. But renunciation of fruit in no way means indifference to the result. In regard to every action one must know the result that is expected to follow, the means thereto, and the capacity for it. He, who, being thus equipped, is without desire for the result and is yet wholly engrossed in the due fulfilment of the task before him is said to have renounced the fruits of his action.” </em></p>

<p>As clearly stated in this passage, action without attachment doesn’t mean indifference or apathy. It means a deliberate choice about where to put our focus. Today, we would say: “focus on the journey, not on the destination”. Another sage, Seneca, said:</p>

<p><em>“Artifici iucundius pingere est quam pinxisse”</em> - painting brings more joy to the artist than to have painted.</p>

<h2>To start is to create</h2>

<p>Action over results, means over ends, are just one aspect of abandoning oneself to the process.</p>

<p>Even more important - at least for creative endeavours - is the belief in the power of getting started. Talking about this, Pablo Picasso once said:</p>

<p><em>“To know what you are going to draw, you have to begin drawing.” </em></p>

<p>From art to science, passing through the philosophy of science, we find an alternative way of saying the same. This one is from Paul Feyerabend in “Against Method”:</p>

<p><em>"Creation of a thing, and creation plus full understanding of a correct idea of the thing, are very often part of one and the same indivisible process and cannot be separated without bringing the process to a stop.”</em></p>

<p>Most ideas acquire their final shape while we are working on them. Nothing is created pure in our mind and then executed. Only through that process - the “creation of a thing” - we can discover what we are actually working on.</p>

<p>For Rem Koolhaas and the architects and designers at Office for Metropolitan Architecture, this is the difference between “projects” and “trajectories”:</p>

<p>“<em>A project is an enterprise that is carefully planned to achieve a particular aim. A trajectory instead includes the explorations, discoveries, numerous detours and unexpected surprises that occur while creating something.</em>”</p>

<p>Paul Graham means something similar when he says that <em>“writing doesn’t just communicate ideas, it generates them.” </em></p>

<h2>Tricks</h2>

<p>And yet somehow, starting keeps being difficult. The fear of moving in the wrong direction paralyses us. Tricking ourselves, and our brain, is the only way out.</p>

<p>Some tricks are unconscious: we see clarity where clarity is missing. We believe a project to be easier than it is. We trust assumptions that turn out to be wrong. Surprisingly - or not really - we often end up with results that are better than the ones we, erroneously, expected.</p>

<p>Albert Hirschmann called it “The Hiding Hand”:</p>

<p><em>”Creativity always comes as a surprise to us; therefore we can never count on it and we dare not believe in it until it has happened. In other words, we would not consciously engage upon tasks whose success clearly requires that creativity be forthcoming. Hence, the only way in which we can bring our creative resources fully into play is by misjudging the nature of the task, by presenting it to ourselves as more routine, simple, undemanding of genuine creativity than it will turn out to be. Or, put differently: since we necessarily underestimate our creativity it is desirable that we underestimate to a roughly similar extent the difficulties of the tasks we face, so as to be tricked by these two offsetting underestimates into undertaking tasks which we can, but otherwise would not dare, tackle.”</em></p>

<p>Another approach, when unable to unconsciously trick ourselves, is to do it on purpose. Improvisation techniques offer a good way of doing that. In “Impro”, Keith Johnstone writes:</p>

<p><em>“You have to trick students into believing that content isn’t important and that it looks after itself, or they never get anywhere.(…)You have to misdirect people to absolve them of responsibility. Then, much later, they become strong enough to resume the responsibility themselves.” </em></p>

<p>Believing that what we are doing is unimportant, that we have no “responsibility”, is also a great way to learn how to throw away things. Nothing of what I quoted here about starting makes sense if we are not able, at the right moment, to throw away whatever we have produced and start from scratch, now under a much better inspiration.</p>

<p>Trick yourself to get started and enjoy the ride.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How to waste an achievement</title>
      <link>http://stefanozorzi.xyz/how-to-waste-an-achievement</link>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="posthaven-post-body"><p>There is nothing more natural - and well deserved - than celebrating an achievement. Celebrations - rewards, more in general - release dopamine and create the desire to feel those emotions again. Achievements beget more achievements. </p>



<p>But achievements can also induce negative behaviours. Behaviours that - when left unchecked - will make it more difficult to accomplish something the next time around. I know - and have felt - two types of such behaviours. </p>



<p>The first is hubris. Hubris comes when we believe to be stronger, smarter, luckier than what we are. When that happens, we become sloppy. We prepare less. We act carelessly. All conditions that are likely to lead us to failure.</p>



<p>A good antidote is to remind ourselves that what generated our success is not a quality we possess but a behaviour we have shown.</p>



<p>A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/14/science/praise-children-for-effort-not-intelligence-study-says.html">famous study</a> about children and motivation has shown that children who connect their achievements to talent are more likely to fail afterwards compared to children who connect their achievements to effort. Knowing that success depends on what we do, and how we do it, is both humbling and motivating. It reminds us that we are the masters of our destiny, but also that failure is always around the corner if we stop paying attention. </p>



<p>The second achievement-generated and failure-inducing behaviour is less visible and for this reason - I argue - even more dangerous. In some ways, it is the opposite of hubris: it doesn’t spur from laziness or lowering the bar, but from raising it. Let me explain with a personal example. </p>



<p>I have recently had the fortune to get some editing help on a post I was writing for my favourite blog, Ribbonfarm. The editor did a great job - thanks, Kevin! - and it improved a lot the quality of my writing. Thanks to that, I have now a new bar, a new standard of quality to aim for. The next time I sit down to write something I am motivated to do at least as good a job as I did on that post. </p>



<p>It is difficult to see something wrong in this increased ambition, but here comes the challenge. As I sit here writing this post, I am way more judgemental about what I am typing. I want each sentence to sound well, I want different paragraphs to be linked well together, I want my arguments to come out clearly and in a nice, logical thread. In other words, I am afraid to do a poor job. I am hesitating. I am hitting backspace a lot.</p>



<p>It reminds me of something I have read in <em>Creativity Inc</em>, Ed Catmull’s book about the story of Pixar. Ideas - Catmull argues - are “ugly babies” who require protection. </p>



<blockquote>

<p>“Early on, all of our movies suck. That's a blunt assessment, I know, but I choose that phrasing because saying it in a softer way fails to convey how bad the ﬁrst versions really are. I'm not trying to be modest or self-effacing. Pixar ﬁlms are not good at ﬁrst, and our job is to make them so—to go, as I say, ‘from suck to not-suck.”</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Accepting that everything we produce - even our most successful creations - starts out ugly is a necessary step to avoid feeling paralysed. In <em>The Shape of Design</em>, Frank Chimero talks about “momentum” as a requirement for any creative effort. And momentum is something we can achieve only if we lower the bar of our inner critical voice: </p>



<blockquote>

<p>“the weight of the objectives (the quality standard in our case) can crush the seeds of thought necessary to begin down an adventurous path. Momentum is the most important aspect of starting, and rejecting and editing too soon has a tendency to stifle that movement.”</p>

</blockquote>



<p>We need to remember that the final output of our work - our achievement - is the product of a carefree ability to start combined with the ambition to reach our highest standards of quality. Not immediately, but eventually. </p></div>]]></content:encoded>
